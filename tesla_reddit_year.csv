1jzhipc,How bad is this for TSLA?,"Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.
Approximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had ""all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.""

In January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.

The situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.

Given the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet.

1jzh33t,Nasdaq Technical Rebound: Entering the Final Phase,"[Nasdaq 100 \(NDX\) Chart](https://preview.redd.it/967ivp69uwue1.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=a46d263de6952e302dcc5a5111f69831d43edd33)

The Nasdaq 100 index is currently encountering strong resistance around the 19,000 level, signaling the end of its technical rebound phase. This pattern echoes past periods of bear market entry, offering investors clues to anticipate the market’s next moves. 

For instance, in January 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening triggered a sudden plunge in the Nasdaq 100, with the index dropping over 20% from its peak. A brief technical rebound followed, but it faced resistance near 15,000 and resumed its decline. A similar scenario unfolded in early March 2020, when the Nasdaq 100 fell 20% from its high, entering a bear market. The 8,800 level acted as a strong resistance, and although an emergency Fed rate cut spurred a rebound, the index soon plummeted again. The current situation bears striking similarities.

Historically, entering a bear market often led to further declines. Yet, recent trends suggest this isn’t always the case. In March 2020, swift Fed rate cuts and quantitative easing propelled U.S. markets to new highs almost immediately. Another example is December 20, 2018, when the Nasdaq 100 dropped over 20% from its peak, entering a bear market, only to rebound quickly after Fed Chair Powell hinted at pausing rate hikes. These instances show how sensitive markets can be to policy interventions, sometimes defying expectations with rapid recoveries. However, with aggressive rate cuts like those in 2020 unlikely today, the possibility of further weakness in the Nasdaq remains a concern.

Stock buybacks have long been a key driver of U.S. market gains, particularly for the Nasdaq. When Trump took office in 2017 and slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, companies redirected tax savings into buybacks. Apple, for example, ramped up its buybacks starting in 2018, spending $100 billion annually and boosting its stock price, pushing its market cap past $1 trillion that year. Recently, its market cap has neared $4 trillion, but the issue is that buyback amounts haven’t scaled significantly—remaining at $110 billion in 2024. Buying back $100 billion worth of stock when the market cap was under $1 trillion had a far greater impact than the same amount with a $3 trillion-plus valuation. To replicate past stock price surges, buybacks might need to reach $300 billion or more, yet there’s little indication of such an increase. This suggests that the effectiveness of buybacks in propping up stock prices is waning.

Since 2017, beyond buybacks, the activation of the stock options market and the rise in leveraged ETF assets have fueled Nasdaq gains. A surge in open interest in options has driven hedging demand—say, a Tesla call option seller buying Tesla stock, positively impacting the cash market. Post-2020, the sharp increase in leveraged ETF assets has brought in fresh buying power, though it’s a double-edged sword. Korean investors, in particular, have amplified U.S. market volatility by heavily purchasing leveraged ETFs. While this can lift prices in the short term, it also heightens market instability.

Trump’s policies are another critical factor. During his first term, tax cuts and surging buybacks drew global capital to U.S. markets, sparking a Nasdaq rally. In contrast, his second term’s excessive tariffs are reversing this trend, triggering capital outflows from both U.S. stocks and bonds. The persistent decline in the dollar index exacerbates this, adding uncertainty. Unlike in March 2020, when Trump stabilized markets with a tariff suspension, his current policies are themselves a risk, eroding investor confidence.

In conclusion, as the Nasdaq’s technical rebound draws to a close, investors should approach the market with caution, informed by historical patterns and economic indicators. The diminishing impact of buybacks, heightened volatility from leveraged ETFs, and uncertainties tied to Trump’s policies point to potential downward pressure. Without significant Fed intervention, reviewing portfolio risks and leaning toward strategies that mitigate volatility seem prudent. **With signs of capital flight from U.S. markets emerging, flexibility in response could prove essential**.

1jxvwyf,"Tesla's Stock Is Set For A ""Death Cross"" On Monday","Tesla's 50-day moving average is about to cross the 200-day, a bearish signal. Meanwhile, vehicle sales are slumping, while the valuation remains high.

Tesla Inc. investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment?

Chief Executive Elon Musk's involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, have been driving the narrative lately on Tesla's stock $(TSLA)$ - for better or worse.

The stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of Musk's closeness to President Donald Trump. Investors hoped his ties to the administration would be positive for Tesla.

Now, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now.

The company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing.

Bud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla.

What does the data tell us about Tesla's stock?

Its technicals look rough

If you're a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends.

As of Friday morning, Tesla was near the ""death cross"", which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal.

""Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,"" Lang said.

Below is a chart from FactSet that shows the near cross of the 50-day moving average to the 200-day moving average as of Friday's close. At current rates, the 50-day can cross over the 200-day on Monday.",2025-04-13 00:53:25,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jxvwyf/teslas_stock_is_set_for_a_death_cross_on_monday/

1jwxb3h,My father thinks he is a guru,"Does anyone have some good responses to wannabe gurus who are so convinced by their wave analyses that nothing can change their mind?

My father has been trading for 25 years but has barely made any profit.. he definitely hasn’t beaten the S&P 500. Yet every few months, he’s convinced that he’s finally found the system and that he’ll be rich in a few years. We often discuss things and its tiring.

The weirdest thing he says is that the markets create the news. He genuinely believes that there are wave movements that cause events. So for example, the other day he’d say the markets didn’t go up 15% because of the news that Trump pauses tariffs, but rather that the markets were supposed to go up 15%, and that’s why such news occured.  
Back in early Februaray, I shorted Tesla after it became clear how bad the sales numbers were, and after Elon did that Nazi salute. My dad said going long was the right move, because the waves analysis said so. He says basing trades on news make no sense.  
What’s always the best part is when he shows in hindsight how he could predict everything perfectly using his waves. When I ask him why he isn’t rich if he can predict markets, he says that the feeling of predicting a stock’s price exactly is worth more than money. He doesn’t see that these predictions work once out of many times and somehow only seem obvious afterwards. There are so many biases at play, it’s insane.

Does anyone deal with people/parents like this? Any good responses? I feel like logic gets you nowhere with him.

1jwjc18,3 Reasons why we reached the bottom,"1. Trump - although many seem to think he is insane, what the evidence suggests is that he still does receive outside information, but simply tends to reject it, if he dislikes it. I'm a narcissistic idiot like him and I can assure you we just think we are always right and everyone else is stupid to not realise what we imagine in our heads. But at some point reality hits the fan and the course has to be reversed. So it is more than likely that we will see some major steps back towards free trade sooner than later.
2. Human greed - many of you point out that the trust in the US is now broken, and nobody would want to invest in us. I think that humans and politicians in particular are way too greedy and they will surely resort to the us stock market despite the insecurity they might have. Think of it like the left wing activists investing in Tesla in 2022-2024, simply because it was a highly profitable bubble, and just ignored all the moral implications.
3. Diversification in manufacturing - there are reasons why China doesn't want a full blown trade war either. Their main MOAT is the pure amount of global manufacturing that they control. But there are many low-income countries which would be more than happy to receive foreign investments for developing manufacturing capacities. This is by the way already an ongoing process and a trade war with Chine would significantly speed it up. For reference - a factory for non-high end technologies can be build for as little as an year, so I think that in 4 years there will be a major shift and diversification in manufacturing if the trade war persists.

1jw5e1w,Tesla Skyrockets Over 22% In A Single Day: Massive dual blast from the ERDF annihilates bears.,"Well... It's time for a little self-deprecating humility and humor. 

Position: I am short on Tesla (still). Yesterday sucked.

In two of my previous posts on r/stocks ""**Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.**"" and **""Forbes: ""Elon Musk's pet project- the dumpster driving Tesla Cybertruck..."" is one of biggest flops in automotive history.**"" I shared my ever growing conspiracy theory predicting the downfall of Tesla based on three things:

1. The ERDF.
2. Unscrupulous accounting that cloaks poor performance.
3. And the downfall of Tesla will eventually be caused by the human element.

Here is how it went down and what we can all learn:

Yesterday, after seeing the ego-fueled feud breaking out between Elon and Navarro (predictable), I desperately continued to search the deep, dark corners of the internet looking for anything to feed my confirmation bias in an attempt to make myself feel better about taking such a risky short position. Then it happened. Just what I was looking for. At **10:06am**, it is announced by Eletrek that Tesla's Director of Accounting Controllership, Harsh Rungta, is leaving the company:

Source: [Tesla’s top financial controller leaves (TSLA) ](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-top-financial-controller-leaves-tsla/)

I think: ""*This is it. It's finally happening!*"". All the pieces are fitting together. Not only is does this fit with my zany prediction (a key person leaving from the accounting side), Harsh Rungta is a former PwC guy (Tesla's independent accounting firm), so he probably has buddies inside that are telling him to jump ship before it sinks. I throw on my tinfoil hat, lick my lips, and wait for the stock to start dropping. 

**10:10am:** Sinister looking faceless people in black downhill bicycle racing helmets wearing gloves start pulling levers and pushing illuminated buttons. The bears don't know it yet- but we are doomed.

**Soon thereafter- ERDF Blast #1 goes off:** My news feed starts getting hit with reports of Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiteraterating his ""outperform"" rating. A rating solely based on the same old tired and empty promises of the same old ripped-off concepts of future vaporware that will turn Tesla into ""not-a-car-company"" (some day), while lowering his massively inflated target price to something appearing slightly more sane to insane people. All the while, conveniently downplaying all the rising competition, trade war implications, and brand destruction happening in plain sight (per usual for these analysts). 

\*Shit- not looking good now\*

**1:18pm:** A second massive blast from the ERDF is released by Trump on Truth Social, announcing a 90-pause in the tariffs. But not for China. They are getting hit with a 125% increase and escalation to escalate the trade-war. (But that doesn't matter. Even though it really does). 

**1:20pm:** The ERDF generates a massive disturbance in the Force (aka- the stock market). Millions of bears suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. *Something terrible has happened.*

What did we learn? Two important things:

1. Headlines beat undercurrents every time. 
2. The ERDF has grown more powerful than anything anyone could have ever imagined. 

For those that want to know: The ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"", or ERDF, is a real thing that I completely made up to make you laugh. 

**The ERDF- What it is and how works:** The EDRF is a headline generating and hype boosting force with unparalleled power. It can use it's force to pull in suckers from all over the world with a single blast and get them to dump money into Tesla stock. It can be used to elevate meme stocks and keep them going up regardless of reality. It is so powerful, that even smart people who understand it's power but don't believe in the company will invest in Tesla stock, knowing there is an endless supply of suckers (and maybe short sellers to squeeze). 

First, it was just Elon capturing the imaginations of people with his vision of a high tech, sporty, eco-friendly, EV with his theatrical stage shows (back when everyone thought he was cool). Then, it grew into something with the power of a Star Destroyer fleet after Elon made a massive (but deliberate) investment to acquire Twitter and change it to X. Now, X is a gargantuan social media platform of purchased/hijacked users which has been transformed into a massive Elon-only-world-view amplifier for the ERDF (i.e., it is highly censored to fit his narrative). Then it grew into a force as strong as a Death Star surrounded by a fleet of Star Destroyers when Elon and Trump pulled a Voltron and combined forces as POTUS and owners of two separate social media companies. Elon would like to use his ERDF to reshape the entire world in his own image now. And sadly, for us mortals, the force of the ERDF has indeed taken over the entire world.

\*Except Wisconsin. The odor of cheese is the only thing that can repel the ERDF and muskrats are terrified of badgers. Coincidence? I think not...

I find the timing of analysts reiterating the same bullish ratings, news, fake news, and social media posts more than a little suspicious. We all know we are being jerked around but the magnitude of swings all this is causing is ridiculous. The markets were tested to see how they would react to a pause in tariffs with fake news, numbers were crunched, then it happened for real. 

Both Trump and Elon openly grift on crypto and I see this as a continuation of a behavior pattern that has worked for them in the past, just using the stock markets. And they aren't even trying to hide their conflicts of interest anymore. Owning your own social media company, where you, as the POTUS, post news releases that create massive, record-breaking intraday swings in the global markets based on reckless, off-the-cuff decisions you are making on the fly, thereby boosting the number of users on your platform by offering an exclusive source of information that has massive and immediate impact on the largest and fastest flows of money in the entire history of the world, is just a slight conflict of interest don't you think? *\*I used 7-commas in that run-on sentence.* 

The thing I find most interesting, is many of the companies that shot waaaaay up (e.g., Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, etc.) should have been completely hammered with the announcement of tariff increases on China. All of these companies have manufacturing and supply chains that are heavily dependant on China and the trade war with them is only escalating. Tesla got a double boost yesterday during all the madness when it should have been a double whammy. As explained by one person that gets paid to write about such matters: 

""*I say I’m not sure why Tesla also surged on this news, but it’s mainly because it’s a meme stock now. It doesn’t really trade on its actual earnings potential.*

*Also, Tesla shareholders appear to be clueless about what’s happening.*""  

(Source: [Tesla (TSLA) surges on Trump announcing bigger tariffs on China that will destroy its energy business](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-tsla-surges-trump-bigger-tariffs-on-china-destroy-energy-business/))

As wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi-like Redditors have warned on my previous posts: ""Stay away from Tesla. It's a meme stock."" They know and respect the power of the ERDF. And as Elon himself has said: ""*There is a large graveyard filled with my enemies. I do not wish to add to it, but will if given no choice.*"" He's not wrong when it comes to short sellers . Also remember: Porkins didn't survive the attack on the Death Star. This next wave of shorties probably won't either. But if fundamentals, actual product sales, brand destruction, and real numbers start mattering to Tesla, the ERDF might come down. That is our only hope.

1jvqn4k,Lessons learned from yesterday,"Yesterday was another crazy day that I live through without stress. Why? I basically exited from us stock market since January.

However, I feel that there are a few things that I learnt that I will share:

- US stock markets are, in the best of cases unpredictable at this point, in the worst case, directly manipulated. In the short term I will avoid US stocks and focus on fundamentals 

- And fundamentals doesn't look good. 
1) The rest of the world has feel a taste of what is coming, and will look how to decouple from US as fast as possible. And starting from services... 
2) Institutional investors will run away from US markets asap. Imaging being a pension fund manager from Europe or Australia and be through all latest movements. For sure, they will look for alternatives and now is probably the best moment for it. 
3) Yesterday many probably become rich, but real economy will have a shock in a few months. DOGE and tariffs will raise unemployment and inflation. It is just a question of time that it translate into quarterly results. And don't expect investments with Al uncertainty.

- Avoid US indexes. The main advantage they provided, diversification, it's over due to the fact that, at this moment whole US companies move in the same direction based on political decisions. In addition, there are companies like Tesla clearly overpriced and that weight too much on some indexes. 

- US bonds are not anymore 100% safe.

Good luck to everyone. 

PS: Personally I am 95% cash and I will start investing in individual stocks that I feel have strong fundamentals ( whenever possible based outside US and which profits and  are not heavily dependant on US). I expect to come back to the market once recession hits and markets realize what is going on in real economy and price it in.

1juhkut,"Forbes: ""Elon Musk's pet project- the dumpster driving Tesla Cybertruck..."" is one of biggest flops in automotive history.","Harsh burn by Forbes. And it's failure is being masked by Tesla. 

Source: [Tesla's Cybertruck Is The Auto Industry’s Biggest Flop In Decades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=46bOzXx2iZI)

Position: I am short on Tesla. 

Tesla has made a significant investment in its manufacturing infrastructure to produce the Cybertruck. Now it isn't selling. It's not even street legal in the UK- and they hate Elon there even more than in the US. Obviously, tariffs aren't going to help Tesla sell into foreign markets either (even if they would buy this junk). Point being, this wasn't a prototype that flopped. This is a flop at full production scale and the loss will be too. 

People in America also miss this inconvenient fact: China's cities and transportation infrastructure isn't built for larger vehicles. If you wanted to capture a large segment of transportation in China, you would be better off making a decent electric scooter- Not this poorly constructed monstrosity. BYD is also eating Tesla's lunch in China (and manufacturing their batteries now too). The Cybertruck is an America only product that has no actual utility except for being a graffiti magnet. 

Lastly, I was ripped for being a conspiracy theorist in one of my previous posts when I postulated that Tesla wasn't being honest with reporting its vehicle sales and overall numbers. Here is a snippet from the video:

 ""... There is no sign that volume is rising this year, with sales trending lower in January and February according to *Cox Automotive*. And Tesla's overall sales are plummeting this year, with deliveries tumbling 13% in the first quarter to 337,000 units, well below consensus expectations of 408,000. *The company did not break out Cybertruck sales, which is lumped in with the Model S and Model X, its priciest segment*. But Ben Kallo, an equity analysis from Baird, said in a research note that it's clear Cybertruck sales were hurt this quarter by the need to make recall related fixes. *Tesla didn't immediately respond for a request for comment...*"" (emphasis mine)

\*Ben Kallo has an ""outperform"" rating on Tesla with a price target of $370. (Source: [Baird’s Ben Kallo: Potential Tesla buyers may think twice if ‘cars are in jeopardy of being keyed’](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/03/10/bairds-ben-kallo-potential-tesla-buyers-may-think-twice-if-peoples-cars-are-in-jeopardy-of-being-keyed.html)) He says: ""Numbers will matter at some point..."". Really? When? The company is valued on the ""bright"" future narrative surrounding it. 

Tesla never responds to requests for comment. Elon just makes a jokester post on X in response to any criticism and lets other people from his fan club explain away all their discrepancies using speculative methods. The Financial Times (FT) article pointing out the [$1.4B ""crack"" in Tesla's accounting](https://www.ft.com/content/62df8d8d-31f2-445e-bfa2-c171ac43db6e) (still posted), that was [kinda-sorta walked back](https://www.ft.com/content/d2711678-af23-4b71-852b-1ef2e932e14b), was explained away by a mocking post from Elon and nameless ""new accountant friends"". Not Tesla. And not PwC- Tesla's independent accounting firm. For all we know, Tesla is already doing something to write-off the Cybertruck flop. As the FT walk-back article states: (the note on their cash flow statement could) ""*...represents the balance of property plant and equipment purchased on credit.*"". It could just be that Tesla is embarrassed by the failure and is throwing it's manufacturing operation in the trash heap and just doesn't want to be specific in an effort to avoid spooking investors. Nobody outside of Tesla knows for sure.

\*Note- [PwC was the auditor for Evergrande](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/china-imposes-six-month-business-suspension-pwcs-auditing-unit-mainland-china-2024-09-13/) that was fined for ""condoning fraud"". How did that one turn out for everyone? 

This brings me to my question: Why doesn't Tesla report more granular sales data? Even if I were a Tesla bull and investor, I would want to see this information. Why does the likes of Cox Automotive and analysts from Baird have to decipher sales using inexact methods (e.g., looking at delayed data in vehicle registration databases)? Tesla does not offer many vehicle models and they own the entire manufacturing-to-sales funnel (i.e., they don't have independent dealerships). According to the bull-narrative, they are supposed to be the world's best whizbang, AI-driven, genius led, smarty-smart-pants company on the planet. That is what is used to justify their absurd valuation. And yet they can't tell anyone how many of each model vehicle they sell. Really? That is a ""bull"" narrative if I have ever heard one.  

Remember- Elon is the guy that just threw together a team at the last minute, walked in the doors of every government agency (more like forced), and instantaneously extracted and supposedly cross-referenced granular data from the likes of the Social Security Administration, whose systems his team was unfamiliar with, and was able to pull out single-person instances of ""fraud"". These systems have millions of people and even more data entries in them. Tesla sells a few hundred thousand cars and built their entire electronic reporting systems themselves. So, Elon can find granular ""fraud"" and ""waste"" in the US government in just a few weeks but can't report his own vehicle sales to his shareholders? Yeah- I'm a skeptic. Where is the fraud and abuse again?  

Before anyone says it: Yeah. Yeah. I am suspiciously reading into things and looking for the most insidious and damning explanations. I get it and I admit it. You don't need to tell me what I already know. ",2025-04-08 16:19:13,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1juhkut/forbes_elon_musks_pet_project_the_dumpster/

Musk had personally appealed to Trump with his case, but was ultimately unsuccessful in changing the President's mind, the Washington Post report said, citing two people familiar with the discussions.
Musk's companies, specifically Tesla (NASDAQ:ISLA), stand to be impacted by the tariffs. While Tesla does manufacture all of its U.S.-sold cars domestically, it still imports several components from China and other countries targeted by Trump's tariffs.

1jty3gi,Apple’s 3-day loss in market cap swells to almost $640 billion,"While the stock market broadly fared better on Monday than in the prior two trading days, Apple got hammered once again, losing 3.7%, as concerns mounted that the company will take a major hit from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The sell-off brings Apple’s three-day rout to 19%, a downdraft that has wiped out $638 billion in market cap.

Apple is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war, analyst say, due largely to its reliance on China, which is facing 54% tariffs. Although Apple has production in India, Vietnam and Thailand, those countries also face increased tariffs as part of Trump’s sweeping plan.

Among tech’s megacap companies, Apple is having the roughest stretch. On Monday, the only stocks to drop in that group of seven were Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.

The Nasdaq finished almost barely up on Monday after plummeting 10% last week, its worst performance in more than five years.

Analysts say Apple will likely either need to raise prices or eat additional tariff costs when the new duties come into effect. UBS analysts estimated on Monday that Apple’s highest-end iPhone could rise in price by about $350, or around 30%, from its current price of $1,199.

Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote that he expects Apple to raise prices, or the company could suffer as much as a 15% cut to earnings per share. Apple may also be able to rearrange its supply chain so that imports to the U.S. come from other countries with lower tariffs.

Apple declined to comment on the tariffs.

(Bloomberg) — One of Wall Street’s most bullish Tesla Inc. analysts slashed his price target for the stock by 43%, citing a brand crisis created by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump’s trade policies.

“Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,” Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who’s rated the carmaker’s shares a buy for the last four years, wrote in a report to clients Sunday. “It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty.”

Ives reduced his Tesla share-price target to $315 from $550, which had been the second-highest among the 72 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

Ives’ biggest concern is the potential for Tesla to get caught up in backlash against the US president’s tariff policies in China, where Tesla generated more than a fifth of its revenue last year. President Xi Jinping’s government plans to impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10, matching the level of Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs on Chinese products.

“This will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng and others,” Ives said in his note issued Sunday. “We now estimate Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self-created brand issues, and this could be a conservative estimate.”

Tesla shares plunged 15% in the two days after Trump announced he would apply at least a 10% tariff on all countries’ imports into the US, with even higher duties on some 60 nations to counter trade imbalances.

And so people are saying not to invest right now or to wait till things calm down and now I’m second guessing if I did the right thing.

Here’s my pie:
	•	Vanguard S&P 500 – 35%
	•	Nvidia – 20%
	•	Microsoft – 20%
	•	Tesla – 15%
	•	Apple – 10%

I put in £250 today (not a lot I know, I’m a student). I’m planning to top up £100 every few months, then once I qualify as a doctor (in 2 years) I’ll start putting in £200 every 3 months. I’m not trying to day trade or anything, I just want to build something solid and stress-free in the background while I study.

But now with all the panic online, I’m wondering if I should’ve waited or if I did the smart thing investing during a dip?

Any advice or reassurance would genuinely help. Just tryna start off right.

1jrtaam,Companies with a large footprint in the US should benefit from the tariffs?,"Someone smarter than me please post a counterargument.

  
My reasoning is that because the reciprocal tariffs increase the cost of imported foreign goods, domestic goods will be cheaper/favorable. This is the whole idea, to shift a focus back to domestic US manufacturing and purchasing. Therefore, companies that don't need to shift and already produce domestically should benefit as consumers and businesses shift to domestic options? The flip side is that if foreign countries retaliate, this would offset the wanted shift obviously.  
So I started listing companies with a large footprint already in the US or that just solely already manufacture the MAJORITY of their stuff in the US:

Tesla, RIVN, Nucor, Steel Dynamics, Deere & Co, TXN, MU, Exxon, Chevron, LMT, RTX, BA.

Meanwhile, a company like Apple produces 80-90% of their iPhones in China and are definitely screwed.

1jrqwdb,Rocket Lab vs SpaceX: The Anti‑Musk Space Investment Campaign,"RKLB: The Musk‑Free Space Stock Ready to Soar 🚀

Elon Musk’s antics and political ties are starting to spook investors – from protests at Tesla showrooms to falling sales . Enter Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB), a pure-play space company with no Musk baggage and strong fundamentals. Rocket Lab just posted record revenue of $436 million in 2024 (up 78% YoY) , yet the stock has pulled back after a recent dip, creating an opportunity. Here’s why RKLB could be a stellar long-term pick:

* Beating Expectations, Despite the Dip: Q4 2024 revenue jumped 121% year-over-year . But cautious Q1 guidance (\~$120M vs $135M expected) spooked the market, and RKLB stock fell \~11% on that news – now down \~30% in the past month . This pullback looks technical, not fundamental, as the company is still growing fast.
* Strong Backlog & Partnerships: Rocket Lab’s order backlog hit $1.1 billion by end-2024 , nearly half from government contracts. They build satellites for NASA/DoD and just won a role in the U.S. Space Force’s NSSL program (a launch contract pool worth up to $5.6B) . In short, reliable revenue streams backed by government and commercial clients.
* Upcoming Catalyst – Neutron Rocket: In 2025, Rocket Lab plans to debut Neutron, a medium-lift, partially reusable rocket aimed at competing with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 . Management confirms it’s on track for H2 2025 launch . Success could unlock larger payload missions and massive new contracts. (Some skeptics think it slips to 2026 , but even a slight delay doesn’t derail the vision.)
* Elon Who? Unlike SpaceX, Rocket Lab is publicly traded and not tied to Musk’s volatility. Musk’s close alliance with politicians and controversial behavior are now seen as business risks . By contrast, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck stays out of politics and focuses on execution. That makes RKLB a cleaner investment narrative if you’re wary of “key-man risk.”

Bottom line: Rocket Lab offers high growth (launch and satellite services) without the Musk drama. Analysts are bullish too (price targets range \~$24–33 , well above the current price). With the stock trading off its highs and Elon’s shine wearing off, RKLB could be ready for liftoff in portfolios looking for the next space success story. Do your DD, but this under-the-radar rocket company might just shoot for the moon.

1jrpy8l,Technology stocks,"Everybody is saying that we can now buy certain stocks discounted.

However, I noticed that most of them went down around 20-25 percent ( Amazon slightly more), which seems everything went down the same. And that is not 100 percent logical.

If stock prices are going down because of probable less revenue and less profits, these drops in my view should not be the same.

1. Apple - 75 percent revenue are hardware. Almost all of it done abroad. Apple should be heavily negatively influenced from tarrifs, and in fact its one of the “better” ones with a fall of around 20-22 percent or so. 

2. Amazon - as mentioned Amazon went down more than Apple from a similar stock price of cca 230 dollars. This is because of the China trade war, and for Amazon I see an exception to my analysis.
3. Alphabet - I did not really check in detail. Shouldnt most od their revenue be services and nothing to do with tariffs? 
Alphabet/Google went from 200 to now 144. Thats again more than 25 percent.

4. META - again, what do they have to do with tariffs?
Drop around same like Google, a bit less.

5. Microsoft - again same as Alphabet and Google. Should it be really?

Tesla is out of my analysis since it was never really deeply connected to the rest in growth and fall.

I don't currently have access to the information, but i would imagine that a sudden - truly unexpected - drop in a blue chip value stock like TSLA would cause an institutions balance sheet to become very lopsided. I'm thinking the current sell off is due to deleveraging against short positions.

Tarrifs are ugly... political and civil unrest - sure... a bit scary, but that seems to have been fuel to the fire as the match was being lit.

Check my thoughts -  but I truly think EM may have gaffe'd the biggest gaffe that has ever been gaffed. Yes, no? Teslas market cap is down close to half a trillion dollars. That is huge.

1jrb0tf,What Musk Leaving DOGE Would Mean for Tesla Stock,"
While Tesla investors adjust to the global trade bombshell, Wall Street is adjusting to DOGE news.

CEO Elon Musk might be stepping back from his Washington, D.C. responsibilities and spending more time in Austin, Texas, soon.

Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were down 6.8% in premarket trading Friday at $249.02, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were dropping 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively. News that China will impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. sent the entire market down.

The early Friday drop followed the stock's 5.5% on Thursday. President Donald Trump's tariffs announcement Wednesday evening simply surprised investors. The levies were much higher than expected, with reciprocal' tariff rates adjusted for 'currency manipulation and trade barriers.""

Tariff news is obscuring Wednesday's 5.3% gain for Tesla stock, which came despite disappointing delivery numbers. Tesla delivered some 337,000 cars, about 40,000 less than Wall Street expected and about 50,000 fewer than the first quarter of 2024.

News from Politico that Musk might end his DOGE career early not deliveries sent shares higher. Investors have worried for weeks the chief executive's political activities have been hurting Tesla's brand. That is why even unconfirmed reports sent shares higher. The White House called Politico's scoop ""garbage.""

Garbage or not, Wall Street appears to believe it's time for Musk to step back from DOGE.

Stepping back matters because it's a crucial time for Tesla, said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. Deliveries fell 13% year over year, and Tesla is supposed to be launching a new vehicle and a robotaxi service in 2025.

""With Musk spending considerable time helping the US government, the market may have questioned if Musk was distracted from his role in leading Tesla,"" added Goldstein in his Wednesday report. His fair value for Tesla stock is $250 a share.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Wednesday that Musk ""slowly but surely moving away from his leadership position in DOGE"" is very bullish for Tesla. He rates shares Buy and has a $450 price target for the stock.

Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow channeled rapper Eminem reviewing DOGE news. ""Guess who's back? back again. Elon's back wrote Jewsikow, playing on lyrics from the star's Without Me track. 'We would note this was already hinted at as early as last week...the narrative is a clear positive for Tesla, could soften some of the political backlash/perceived backlash, and could improve employee morale.""

Jewsikow rates shares Sell and has a $170 price target for shares.

What is a DOGE retreat worth to Tesla stock? That is hard to say. Tesla stock was about $425 a share before the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. (At the time, first-quarter delivery estimates were closer to 450,000 vehicles.) Tesla stock closed on Thursday below $270 a share.

BofA strategist Savita Subramanian noted earlier this week that fund managers have been selling Tesla stock since the election. Some of that institutional selling might have been due to tariff fears or profit-taking. Some is likely because of Musk, and some of that money coming back could boost shares.

In the longer term, any rebound will depend on car buyers returning. Is any brand damage permanent? It's hard to know now.

It could be too late. J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman cut his first-quarter estimates after first-quarter deliveries confirmed ""unprecedented brand damage,"" he feared. Brinkman isn't sure what to make of the Politico story, ""what does seem clear, however, is that the trend in Tesla sales is worse than we and the market had appreciated.""

Brinkman rates Tesla stock Sell and has a $120 price target for the stock. CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson rates shares Buy and has a $360 price target for the stock.

In a recent report, he pointed out that some of the sales weakness was related to lower production of Tesla's most popular car, the Model Y. It was recently updated, causing some buyers to wait for the new model. Nelson sees a rebound coming in the second quarter.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",2025-04-03 18:13:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

1jqgunf,Why a China–Korea–Japan Free Trade Deal Would Be a Huge Win for BYD,"TL;DR: A tri-nation FTA would give BYD cheaper access to two lucrative markets, fortify its supply chain, and encourage more partnership with top-tier Japanese and Korean firms. All that translates to faster growth and possibly fatter profits for BYD. It’s the kind of macro tailwind that could make BYD’s ambitious global goals (like that 800k overseas sales target) even more achievable. As a BYD enthusiast, I’d be very excited to see this free trade deal happen – it could be a sleeper catalyst for BYD’s stock in the long run.

 So let's talk BYD and free trade. Imagine China, South Korea, and Japan sign a free trade agreement (FTA) – no tariffs, smoother trade, tighter supply chains. As a long-time BYD watcher, I genuinely think BYD would love this scenario. Here’s my take on why BYD could be one of the biggest beneficiaries:

More BYDs on Korean and Japanese Roads

Improved export access = more sales. BYD has been aggressively expanding into both Japan and South Korea, and an FTA would throw the doors wide open. In Japan, BYD only entered in 2023 and sold 2,223 EVs in 2024 – surprisingly surpassing Toyota’s EV sales (2,038 units) in their own home market​. That’s a tiny fraction of Japan’s ~4 million annual auto sales, but it shows BYD’s potential. They’re so bullish that they plan to open 100 dealerships in Japan by 2025​. Now, picture those BYD showrooms if exports face zero trade barriers. Japanese EV adoption is just getting started (EVs were <2% of Japan’s auto sales in 2024​), so easier access could let BYD ride the coming wave as Japan catches up on electrification.

In South Korea, BYD is also making moves. They just launched models like the Dolphin hatchback (aka Atto 3) and Seal sedan in early 2025 with aggressive pricing (around $21k) aimed at undercutting Hyundai and Kia​. BYD literally said they’re in Korea “for the long haul” and will start with affordable EVs to gain a foothold​ chosun.comThe Korean EV market is growing (about 99,000 EVs sold in 2024, ~6% of total car sales​), and Korean consumers have shown they’ll buy foreign EVs if the deal is good – Tesla’s sales in Korea jumped 548% last year to nearly 30k units wants a piece of that action, and a tri-nation FTA would only accelerate this. With freer trade, exporting more vehicles into Korea and Japan becomes simpler and cheaper, allowing BYD to scale up dealerships and marketing without so much red tape.

Let’s not forget BYD’s broader global push: the company is already on fire overseas. In the first quarter of 2025, BYD’s overseas sales doubled, topping 206,000 NEVs (EVs + plug-in hybrids) sold outside China through March​. They’re aiming for 800,000 overseas sales in 2025, roughly double 2024’s level​. Gaining frictionless access to nearby wealthy markets like Japan and Korea could add significant volume on top of BYD’s growth in Europe, Latin America, etc. It’s basically low-hanging fruit next door. As one Reuters analysis noted, BYD sees “great opportunities” in markets friendly to Chinese EVs​ – and an FTA would make Japan/Korea way more friendly by default.

Tariff-Free = Cheaper EVs (or Better Margins)

One immediate benefit of a free trade pact would be zero tariffs on cars and batteries moving between the three countries. This is huge for BYD. Right now, importing cars into South Korea incurs an 8% tariff, which BYD has even been absorbing itself to keep prices low​ (Talk about commitment – BYD literally ate the 8% tax just so Korean buyers wouldn’t feel it, making their EVs more competitively priced!). If a China-Korea FTA scrapped that duty, BYD could either drop prices further (boosting demand) or stop sacrificing that 8% off their margins. Either way, BYD wins.

In Japan, auto import tariffs are already pretty low (Japan has prided itself on open auto markets in terms of tariffs​). But an FTA would lock in zero tariffs on EVs and also likely cut duties on EV components. Think about batteries, for example. BYD not only makes cars but is a major battery producer; under free trade, shipping BYD’s batteries or battery cells to partners in Japan/Korea would be cheaper. Likewise, any high-tech parts BYD imports from Japan/Korea for its cars (semiconductors, camera systems, etc.) would drop in cost. It’s a supply chain cost advantage on both ends.

Crucially, a tri-country FTA would shield BYD from the kind of tariff threats popping up in the West. Europe has been mulling tariffs on Chinese EVs, and the U.S. has been generally hostile with trade barriers. BYD’s chairman has openly discussed how tariffs abroad are a concern and said BYD might respond by assembling cars locally to “overcome tariffs” in those regions​. But if China, Japan, and Korea are freely trading, BYD doesn’t need costly local factories or workarounds for those markets – they can ship finished cars directly. No 10% EU tariff equivalent, no Trump-style surprises. Just sell the car and bank the revenue. This kind of stable, tariff-free access would make Japan and Korea very attractive markets for BYD to focus on, since their cost advantage would fully translate to showroom prices. One Bloomberg piece even noted BYD’s $21k starting price in Korea undercuts local EVs by being so low​– remove tariffs and BYD could sustain such aggressive pricing more profitably.

Bottom line: lower tariffs = lower prices = more competitive BYD EVs. Given BYD’s strength is value-for-money, an FTA turbocharges that advantage in Japan and Korea.

Stronger East Asian EV Supply Chains

BYD isn’t just a carmaker; they’re an integrated EV supply chain beast (batteries, electronics, you name it). A free trade agreement would knit China, Japan, and South Korea’s industries closer, which plays right into BYD’s hands. These three countries combined account for nearly 40% of global manufacturing output, including dominating sectors like semiconductors, EVs, and batteries​. In other words, East Asia is already the powerhouse of the EV world – and BYD is a major player in that powerhouse. If trade barriers drop, it becomes a lot easier to source the best components regionally and optimize costs.

For instance, Japan and South Korea are leaders in certain EV components: think of Japan’s electronics (chips from Renesas, sensors from Denso) or Korea’s advanced battery materials and displays. Under an FTA, BYD could import high-tech parts from Japanese and Korean suppliers tariff-free and likely faster. That means BYD’s cars can benefit from top-notch components at lower cost. Similarly, BYD could export its own components to partners in those countries. Perhaps Japanese automakers might buy BYD’s affordable batteries (BYD’s blade battery tech is world-class), or Korean firms could source BYD’s EV semiconductors or motors. With fewer trade frictions, a more efficient regional EV supply chain forms, and BYD can slot right into it as both supplier and assembler.

We’re already seeing hints of such collaboration. All three governments have talked about strengthening supply chain cooperation in high-tech sectors as part of improving trilateral trade ties​. For example, South Korea and Japan want reliable access to China’s rare earths and battery materials, while China wants chips from Japan/Korea​. EVs benefit directly from this kind of exchange: BYD needs advanced chips (which Japan/Korea excel at), and Japanese/Korean automakers need battery tech (which BYD offers). A freer trade environment makes these exchanges smoother and less politically fraught.

One likely focus area is EV battery supply chains. Batteries often have materials crisscrossing borders (lithium processed in China, cells made in Korea, etc.). With an FTA, these materials and parts could move across China, Japan, and Korea with minimal hassle, lowering the cost to build each battery pack. BYD’s cars – and also its battery sales to other OEMs – would get a cost edge from that. In a sense, the FTA could encourage a regional EV “ecosystem” where each country specializes a bit (China mass-produces, Japan provides precision components, Korea contributes tech and refinement) to collectively take on Western competitors. BYD, given its scale and vertical integration, would be in a prime spot to orchestrate and benefit from this synergy.

Tech Partnerships & Investments: BYD + Japan/Korea = 💕

Perhaps the most exciting (and underrated) benefit: a free trade deal would likely foster more tech collaboration and cross-investment between companies in China, Japan, and Korea – which could hugely aid BYD. Free trade isn’t just about goods; it builds trust and business ties. And when borders are more open, big players tend to team up rather than reinvent the wheel.

BYD’s already got notable friends in Japan/Korea. Case in point: Toyota. The Japanese giant struck a joint venture with BYD to co-develop electric cars, pooling their R&D talent. Engineers from both companies are literally working under one roof to “develop BEVs that are superior in performance... by merging the two companies’ strengths,” as the JV’s CEO put it​. This kind of partnership was once unthinkable – a top Japanese automaker relying on a Chinese firm’s EV tech – but BYD’s expertise (especially in batteries) made it happen. An FTA would likely encourage more partnerships like Toyota-BYD, by assuring Japanese and Korean firms that cooperation with Chinese companies is a safe, long-term bet (no sudden trade wars to wreck the venture). We could envision, say, Honda or Nissan collaborating with BYD on battery supply, or Korean firms like Samsung expanding their investment in BYD.

Speaking of Samsung – they actually invested $450 million in BYD a few years back​, taking a small stake to cooperate on electric car chips and batteries. That’s a Korean electronics titan effectively betting on BYD’s auto future. Similarly, there are reports of other tech exchanges (for example, rumors that BYD might supply batteries to certain Japanese EV projects, etc.). If China/Japan/Korea enter a free trade framework, it lowers the political risk of such deals and likely removes caps or hassles on cross-border investments. BYD could more easily attract capital or partnerships from say, a SoftBank or a Hyundai Mobis, who might want exposure to its EV battery business or its fast-growing EV lineup.

For BYD, more collaboration means faster innovation and market penetration. Partnering with established Japanese and Korean players can help BYD improve its tech (imagine BYD using Sony sensors or Samsung displays in its cars seamlessly) and also gain local market insights. It’s a two-way street: those partners get BYD’s cost-efficient tech, and BYD gains credibility and technical refinement. A trade deal acting as a green light for such tie-ups is a big strategic win for BYD’s long-term growth. As a cherry on top, freer investment flows might even allow BYD to set up joint factories or R&D centers in Japan/Korea down the line, further ingraining them in those markets (and creating jobs there, which governments love).

The Long-Term Growth Boost

Tie it all together, and BYD stands to gain on multiple fronts: more sales opportunities, lower costs, stronger tech, and bigger allies. In a business as globally competitive as electric vehicles, those advantages can be game-changing. BYD is already the world’s largest EV maker by volume, and it’s hungry for global market share. A China-Korea-Japan FTA would effectively hand BYD a “home field” advantage across East Asia – a region with huge car markets and tech resources. It’s no surprise analysts are buzzing about East Asian economic cooperation. These three countries combined are an economic juggernaut (quarter of global GDP) with massive auto industry clout​.

If they tear down trade barriers among themselves, companies like BYD that can integrate across borders will be in pole position.

From an investor’s perspective, this kind of free trade pact would make the bull case for BYD’s international expansion even stronger. It de-risks their Asia expansion and could add a few percentage points to profit margins on each car sold in Japan/Korea (thanks to tariff removal and supply chain efficiencies). It also signals that major governments in the region are supportive of EV industry growth via cooperation, not protectionism – which bodes well for BYD not getting shut out. Remember, a rising tide lifts all boats: BYD’s success in Japan and Korea could also positively pressure local rivals to step up, expanding the overall EV market pie (which BYD gets a slice of).",2025-04-03 12:15:28,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqgunf/why_a_chinakoreajapan_free_trade_deal_would_be_a/

1jps3gk,Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs,"(Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

Rivian produced 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 13,980 a year ago. It reaffirmed its annual deliveries forecast.

A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,

Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).

No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain.

1jpo69r,"Tesla reports 336,000 vehicle deliveries in first quarter","Tesla reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company’s stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000
* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000

Investors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla’s investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.

In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

Tesla doesn’t break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454 of its most popular Model 3 and Model Y cars and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.

The company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.

During the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.

CEO Elon Musk recently said during an all-hands session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the “best-selling car on Earth again this year.” 

But Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk’s political rhetoric and his work as part of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

After spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he’s slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.

Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February’s elections. Tesla’s business on the continent is struggling.

Across 15 European countries, Tesla’s market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla’s market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.

Tesla shares sank 36% in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.

The reason is Tesla's stance on union rights, which conflicts with Folksam's investment criteria.

 The insurance giant states that it has tried to influence the electric car company to bring about a change, without results.

 ""Unfortunately, no improvement has been seen and a decision has therefore been made to divest the holding,"" the Folksam Group writes in the press release.

 \- This is not the result we had hoped for, says Marcus Blomberg, Head of Asset Management and Sustainability at the Folksam Group.

 The Folksam Group's investment criteria are based on international conventions and the UN Global Compact.

1jpicww,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",2025-04-02 06:47:15,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/

1joht47,Stocks close out their worst quarter since 2022 amid tariff uncertainty,"Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate.

The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday’s close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023.

The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months.

The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022.

Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate.

The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday’s close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023.

The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months.

The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022.

The index’s first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year’s gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the “magnificent 7,” have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year.

The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia’s late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price.",2025-03-31 23:45:17,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1joht47/stocks_close_out_their_worst_quarter_since_2022/
1jo91nk,Elon Musk says backlash against his DOGE government cuts is hurting Tesla stock,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Sunday that his involvement in the Trump administration could be hurting the automaker’s stock price.

Speaking at a town hall event in Wisconsin, Musk said his role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency — which is pushing for widespread government job cuts — is creating backlash against his electric car company and hurting the stock.

“What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ... stop doing this,” Musk said, according to Bloomberg News. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.”

Shares of Tesla entered Monday already down more than 34% year to date, and the stock has been cut nearly in half from its peak in December. Shares were down an additional 6% in premarket trading Monday.

The drop for the stock could be a “buying opportunity” for the long term, said Musk, who was in Wisconsin ahead of a state supreme court election there. Musk has campaigned for the conservative candidate and spent more than $12 million on the race, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at Sunday’s rally for signing a petition against “activist judges.”

The slumping stock isn’t the only sign of public anger with Musk for his political work. Protesters demonstrated at Tesla dealerships over the weekend, and there have been reports of vandalism against vehicles and dealers across the country.

Musk’s role in politics is not limited to DOGE. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024 and has been a regular presence at the White House since the new administration took over in January. He also regularly comments on many different political topics on X, the social media company he owns.

The CEO’s rising political profile comes amid signs that Tesla’s core business is slowing. The automaker’s vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary data has shown that sales are down again early this year, especially in Europe. In a note to clients Sunday, investment firm Stifel trimmed its price target on the stock and lowered its sales projections for Tesla.

Musk’s political dealings may not be the only reason for Tesla’s struggles. Other U.S. auto stocks have also labored in recent weeks, partly because of threats of higher tariffs on imported goods into the U.S. and retaliation from overseas trading partners, adding uncertainty to an industry whose supply chains are tightly woven among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

“Shares of electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 5.3% to $249.6 in premarket trading on Monday, following a downgrade from Stifel.

The brokerage cut its price target on Tesla stock from $474 to $455 and significantly lowered its full-year 2025 delivery forecast from 17% growth to just 4%.

Stifel cited the rollout of the new Model Y (Juniper) and growing negative sentiment toward CEO Elon Musk as key factors impacting the company’s outlook.”

I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). 

**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. 

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d) \- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term.

1jnvqnv,Why is Tesla Worth Anything?,"Chinese BYD company has just outsold Tesla worldwide and is taking over European markets.

Why don't investors price this in?

We say NVDA crashing after deepseek came out. BYD is way more dangerous to Tesla than Deepseek is to Open AI.

BYD had great cars for as low as $10,000. Without tarrifs, BYD would come to the US and completely wipe Tesla out.

I suppose this can be delayed through tarrifs but long term, it looks like Tesla is cooked.

BYD sells cars twice as good for half the price.

So why is Tesla stock worth so much if BYD is beating it all over the world and if tarrifs were removed, BYD would wipe Tesla out in the US as well.",2025-03-31 05:06:43,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jnvqnv/why_is_tesla_worth_anything/
1jngg3e,Challenging the Noise: A Closer Look at Tesla's Q1 Projections,"As we have all seen, there are a ton of headlines about Tesla's (TSLA) declining sales numbers, and it's honestly a bit overwhelming. Here's a quick breakdown of what I gathered:

* Europe sales are reportedly down by 45%
* China sales have decreased by either 49% or 29%
* Australia sales are down by 65.5%

\^\^ keep in mind there are a ton of articles and headlines on this, I picked from a few \^\^

With all these headlines, it's tough to figure out what timeframes they're talking about. Is it one day, one week, three months? Who knows?

Amidst all this noise, I decided to dig deeper into what we should actually expect. While analysts' projections aren't great, they don't seem as grim as the headlines suggest.

**Global Tesla Sales (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 386,810 units
* **2025 Initial Projections**: 412,000 units (median of 398K-426K range, which would've been a 6.5% increase)
* **2025 Current Projections**: 377,000 units (a 2.5% decrease from Q1 2024)
* **Projection Change**: Initial to current projections dropped by 8.5%

**USA Sales Breakdown (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 140,187 vehicles
* **2025 Current Projection**: 138,867 vehicles
* **Change**: Only a 0.9% decrease in the US market

These numbers don't look great, especially for a company like Tesla that's all about growth. But we're still talking about single-digit declines quarter-over-quarter, assuming the analysts are somewhat correct.

I wanted to understand what the Q1 report might reveal because, going by the headlines, it seemed like it would be terrible. But after digging in, it doesn't seem as bad as it feels. Is it just me?

What do you all think? Could the market react less harshly on Q1 review day than the news is making it out to be?",2025-03-30 16:37:34,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jngg3e/challenging_the_noise_a_closer_look_at_teslas_q1/
1jlvzdl,TSLA - Premliminary Tesla registration numbers from March 2025 in Europe.,"Someone (in [r/RealTesla](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/)) posted a table of preliminary registration numbers for a few European countries. In some countries like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, they are down by aprox 60-70% in March 2025 compared to last year  (March 2024), even after Model Y changeover has finished.

In Norway, Tesla is once again the best seller, but it's still down by around 20% from March 2024, and the Q1 total is down around 30%.

There is currently no supply shortage, since you can order a new Model Y Juniper and get delivery almost the same day. The source for the numbers were taken from this website: [https://eu-evs.com/](https://eu-evs.com/)

One country had an increase in sales 25% (Spain).

Overall for the countries listed it was down est around 36%.

1jkxq24,Elon Musk Is One of the Few Winners From Trump Auto Tariffs,"> Donald Trump’s planned tariffs on auto imports will hurt carmakers around the world and push up prices for US consumers. Among the many losers, one winner stands out: Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc.

> The electric vehicle maker has large factories in California and Texas that churn out all the cars it sells in the US, insulating it to a greater degree from Trump’s new levies on imported cars and key components. Major rivals from South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. to Germany’s Volkswagen AG and America’s own General Motors Co. meanwhile will soon face sharply higher costs.

> Tesla is the “least exposed” to the new duties due to its domestic manufacturing operations, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in an analysis this week. Tesla itself has been boasting this week about its US credentials, saying in a post on X that its models “are the most American-made cars.

1jko4ew,"Tesla shares drop on plunging European sales, concerns about Trump's tariffs","Tesla shares fell almost 6% on Wednesday as data from Europe showed slowing sales last month, and investors grew increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump’s plan for tariffs.

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) revealed on Tuesday that Tesla saw a 40% year-over-year drop in new vehicle registrations in Europe in February, while overall battery electric vehicle sales were up 26%.

Meanwhile, the White House said on Wednesday that President Trump will announce new tariffs on auto imports in the afternoon. The president has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one” for rolling out his plan to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners, but Trump hinted earlier this week that auto tariffs could arrive sooner.

Movements of this magnitude have become commonplace for Tesla’s stock. On 14 separate days this year, Tesla shares have gained or lost at least 5%. Wednesday’s selloff, alongside a 2% drop in the Nasdaq, followed a five-day rally that included a 12% jump on Monday.

The trend for the year has been downward, particularly since President Trump began his second term in January, and brought Tesla CEO Elon Musk with him to the White House. Tesla shares are down 36% since Inauguration Day, after falling 28% in February, the steepest drop for any month since December 2022.

Following the ACEA report on Tuesday, RBC analysts wrote in a note that the February numbers only represented a drop of about 11,000 Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe, and emphasized that data for the month “might not be indicative of true demand.”

New car buyers in Europe, the analysts said, “could be holding out for the Model Y refresh,” or a “new affordable model,” which they expect in the second half of the year.

Tesla is set to fully ramp up production of the redesigned version of its Model Y SUV next month. The company implemented partial production shutdowns at certain factories earlier this year to upgrade Model Y manufacturing lines.

Some prospective EV buyers have been turned off of late by Musk’s political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, where he’s leading an effort to slash federal government spending, cut the federal workforce, and has said he wants to privatize many services, including social security.

William Blair analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that, “pushback from Musk’s foray into politics” has led to “brand damage and even vandalism,” for Tesla at a time when the company’s supply has been impacted by its Model Y changeover, and “Chinese competition continues to heat up.”

Still, the firm maintained its buy recommendation on Tesla’s stock, pointing to growth in the company’s energy storage business, and its prospects in driverless ride hailing. Musk has promised that Tesla will kick off a robotaxi service in Austin in June. The company has yet to begin production of its dedicated robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab.

Alphabet’s Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi service in Austin and other markets. And in China, several automakers are now offering an equivalent to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Supervised — a premium, partially automated driving system — as standard options rather than a paid service.

In China this week, Tesla renamed its FSD system “Intelligent Assisted Driving,” according to CNEVPost, after previously branding it as “Full Self-driving Capability.” Tesla’s system in all markets still requires a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

1jkg3ak,Stop pretending you know the market,"I've been investing for a couple of years. My longs are looking great, even with the most recent dips. Got confident last November and decided to learn about trading and started doing it with small money. Five months later with some losses and some gains, and my conclusion is pretty straightforward: just don't trade. The only thing you are guaranteed to lose and never get back: hours of your life.

Especially with Trump and the current administration, the average trader will never be able to read the market with enough confidence to know what they are doing.

This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Trump Says Tariffs Coming In April Will Probably Be More Lenient Than Reciprocal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/trump-says-tariffs-coming-in-april-will-probably-be-more-lenient-than-reciprocal.html)

[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d) **-** Reported earnings, EPS of $0.29 vs $0.08 expected. EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen’s meeting with Strategy’s chairman. **This is a massive catalyst** solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada’s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).

[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-** DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market. Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China’s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on

1jjvzui,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

1jjrhhe,Chinese EV giant BYD outpaces Tesla with annual sales of more than $100 billion,"Chinese automaker BYD reported annual revenue of 777 billion yuan ($107 billion) for 2024, leapfrogging U.S. rival Tesla as competition between the two electric vehicle rivals heats up.

In a filing published Monday, BYD posted a 29% increase in revenue from the previous year, bolstered by sales of its hybrid vehicles. This figure exceeded the $97.7 billion annual revenue reported by Elon Musk’s Tesla.

Wang Chuanfu, chairman and president of BYD, hailed the firm’s “rapid development” in 2024, noting the company became the first automaker globally to reach the milestone of rolling out 10 million new energy vehicles in November.

“BYD has become an industry leader in every sector from batteries, electronics to new energy vehicles, breaking the dominance of foreign brands and reshaping the new landscape of the global market,” Wang said in a statement.

The filing comes shortly after BYD announced a new battery technology that it claims can charge EVs almost as quickly as it takes to fill a gasoline car.

The automaker said last week that it’s new so-called Super e-Platform will allow cars that use the technology to achieve 400 kilometers (roughly 249 miles) of range with just five minutes of charging. CNBC could not independently verify these claims.

Analysts hailed BYD’s new battery platform as “out of this world” and suggested the development could lead to a profound change of behavior among EV owners.

Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD have rallied 46% year to date.

Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, have tumbled more than 31% so far this year, amid rising consumer boycotts and plummeting demand globally driven in part by Musk’s rise as a hard-line conservative political figure.

Wood told Bloomberg that she expects Tesla’s robo taxis to be the company’s biggest value driver in the next five years, and that the share price was not even factoring in Tesla’s plans for humanoid robots.

Wood’s forecast predicts Tesla’s valuation at nearly 10 times from current levels, as the EV maker grapples with a severe drop in valuation over the past four months. The $2,600 forecast has been touted by Ark in the past. 

Tesla is the biggest component of Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation (NYSE:[ARKK](https://www.investing.com/etfs/ark-innovation)) exchange-traded fund, which holds about $646 million worth of shares in the EV maker. Tesla is also by far Ark’s biggest holding across its other ETFs, according to data from Cathie’s Ark.

1jiqjct,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

This has resulted in a market bounce and overall means that markets will likely NOT be as impacted by tariffs as they were expecting. 

The tariff game Trump is playing reminds me of that scene from the office: ""You have no idea the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person! Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!"" -Michael Scott. 

Anyway back to the watchlist. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs—interested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.

[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results. Q4 revenue of $54.7M (+80% YoY) and FY24 revenue of $228.0M (nearly 3x YoY).

Backlog reached $328.3M (+22% YoY), with **projected positive run-rate Adj. EBITDA by year-end**. Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return. Also watching RKLB on this. 

[**AZEK (The AZEK Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AZEK&p=d)\- James Hardie to acquire AZEK in a cash/stock deal valued at $8.75B (including debt). AZEK holders to receive $26.45 cash + 1.034 JHX shares, totaling \~$53/share (as of premarket prices)**.** These hybrid stock/cash acquisitions can fluctuate in price because of how the acquirer pays with their own stock. Typical M&A risks apply such as integration risk, housing market softness, FX exposure (James Hardie also trades in Australia IIRC), regulatory risk, etc.

1jinzxp,TSLA: Tesla to roll out full self-driving in China after software approval,"# Tesla halts driving-assistance software trial in China, pending approval

BEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) said on Monday it would release its smart driving-assistance feature in China after completing regulatory approval, following complaints that a limited-time free trial of its Full Self-Driving service had been temporarily paused.""All parties are actively advancing the relevant process and we will push it to you as soon as it is ready. We are also looking forward to it, please wait patiently,"" Tesla's customer support said on social media platform Weibo.

#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”

> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”

Those are absolutely bonkers, and I’m genuinely grateful for the encouragement and engagement. I’ve been a long-time lurker on this subreddit, learning quietly from many of you over the years. I never imagined that something I’d write would get this kind of traction. But some of the comments in that thread raised important questions and valid counterpoints—so I wanted to follow up with a deeper response.

Now, for those asking for charts, crayons, or simplified pictures—just a heads-up: this sub doesn’t support image uploads. So if you're looking for visual aids, you’ll need to do a bit of homework and look up the references and data I mention here. Trust me, it’s worth your time.

Also, there will be no TL;DR at the end of this post. If you’re someone who can’t—or won’t—read through a detailed explanation, then this probably isn’t for you. The economy, and the factors that influence how a stock moves, are complex. If you're not willing to engage with that complexity, you’re setting yourself up to get burned. So, with that said, let’s dive in.

This comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/)

Tesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information.

[https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024](https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024)

Now let's talk about sale of regulatory credits. These are *not actual cars sold*—they're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn’t meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard—like Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric. Then it sells them to other automakers who still rely on gas-powered cars. This is essentially free money for Tesla—it doesn’t cost them anything to generate these credits, but they can sell them for hundreds of millions of dollars.

As for interest income, this is money Tesla earns just for having cash in the bank or investments. Tesla holds billions in cash and short-term investments. Instead of letting it sit there, they invest it in safe, interest-earning instruments (like U.S. Treasury bonds or money market funds). This also include bitcoin. As interest rates rise, these earnings go up—so Tesla earns hundreds of millions per quarter just from letting their money sit and grow.

Remember what I said about bitcoin in the previous post? ""In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060) If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.""

If this number hold true, Tesla interest income from bitcoin will drop by 9.96%.

With that said, the saying that Tesla doesn't make money from car isn't true. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue—which includes income from vehicle sales and related services—totaled approximately $18.8 billion. This figure represents about 73% of Tesla's total revenue of $25.7 billion for the same period. For the entire year of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue amounted to $72.5 billion, accounting for approximately 74% of the total annual revenue of $97.7 billion. Remember the stuff about regulator credit above? These percentages indicate that automotive sales remain the primary contributor to Tesla's revenue, both quarterly and annually. Tesla is still a car company at heart, and this was it moat.

You might not know this about me, but I used to be a hardcore Tesla fanboy. I invested in the company back when they were just producing the original Roadster. Over the years, I’ve owned *every single product* Tesla has put out—including four of their vehicles.

Tesla’s sky-high valuation wasn’t just hype—it was because the company was doing things no one else dared to. It was more than just an automaker; it was positioned as a tech and AI company, with aspirations in robotics and full self-driving. But even beyond that, Tesla was pioneering a completely new model of vertical integration.

It wasn’t just about selling electric cars. Tesla popularized EVs, achieved massive adoption rates, and built an entire ecosystem around the vehicle. They sold their own insurance, handled their own repairs, created and *standardized* their own charging port (which others later adopted), and developed the most expansive EV charging network in the world.

Elon Musk wasn’t just building a car company—he was positioning Tesla to be the Rockefeller of the 21st-century automotive industry. Just like how Rockefeller controlled the oil pipeline from extraction to distribution, Tesla was aiming to control everything:

* Design and manufacturing of the vehicles
* Repair and servicing (only Tesla could repair a Tesla)
* Insurance and financing
* And the “gas stations” of the future—their Supercharger network

It was a brilliant playbook, and it echoed what made Sony so dominant in the 1990s: Sony owned the formats. Whether it was CDs, MiniDiscs, Blu-ray, or the Walkman headphone jack, Sony created the platforms and *collected royalties* when others used them.

Had Tesla stayed on that course—doubling down on ecosystem control and technological dominance—they truly had a shot at owning the entire EV industry. But somewhere along the way, they pivoted, and that vision started to drift.

I was a fanboy of Tesla, and I sold everything in November. I also started shorting Spy, but hopefully, I have time to talk about the economy in this post.

What truly broke the long-term vision for Tesla, in my eyes, was the company’s decision to step back from its charging station expansion—the very dream of becoming the next-generation energy empire, replacing Shell, Chevron, Mobil, and essentially every gas station in the world.

In late April 2024, Tesla made a dramatic internal shift by disbanding its entire Supercharger team, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. This wasn’t a small reorganization—it was a major strategic reversal. The move immediately sparked concern about the future of Tesla’s vast charging infrastructure, which had once been one of its most significant competitive advantages.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Supercharger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Supercharger)

In response, Elon Musk stated that Tesla would still grow its Supercharger network—but at a much slower pace. The new focus would be on maintaining 100% uptime and expanding existing sites, rather than continuing the rapid rollout of new stations across the country and around the world. This change came as part of broader company-wide layoffs and a growing strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and robotics.

[https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/)

For Tesla’s automotive partners—like Ford, GM, and Rivian, who had recently committed to adopting Tesla’s NACS charging standard—this sudden shift caused confusion and uncertainty. They had signed on with the expectation that Tesla would continue leading the way in EV infrastructure. Now, that future looked far less clear.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/)

As a Tesla owner in California, where EV adoption is highest, I’ve already started to see the consequences firsthand. Fewer new charging stations are being built, and the reliability of existing ones is noticeably declining. Increasingly, I encounter broken or malfunctioning Superchargers—something that used to be rare. In some locations, the charging speeds are significantly slower than they used to be—sometimes even half as fast.

On top of that, Tesla has introduced energy usage-based time rates, and the cost of charging has surged. What used to be a convenient and cost-effective option now feels like a premium-priced service. Three years ago, I used Superchargers without thinking twice. Today, I charge almost exclusively at home—because it’s five to eight times cheaper. Furthermore, you have to think about the high cost of housing and the majority of people renting or living in an apartment. They would have all had to use the Tesla charging stations for every EV car. Think about this implication!

**The bigger picture here is that Elon Musk had the chance to be a modern-day Rockefeller. He was on track to own the entire energy pipeline for electric vehicles: manufacturing the cars, selling the insurance, controlling the repairs, and operating the “gas stations” of the EV era through the Supercharger network.**

But that opportunity has slipped away. The dream of Tesla owning the entire EV ecosystem—end to end—has fractured. And it’s hard not to see this as a major strategic misstep.

u/Qc4281 ""I believe the Bulls are putting all of their hope in robotaxis and regardless of Q1, June will be the real test of how much support Tesla continues to have.""

It’s time to face a hard truth: Tesla is no longer on the cutting edge of robotaxi technology. As of 2025, the undisputed leader in autonomous ride-hailing is Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company).

Waymo operates at SAE Level 4 autonomy, meaning their vehicles can drive themselves without any human inside, in specific geofenced areas. This isn’t a prototype—it’s real, operational, and public.

Their Waymo One robotaxi service is live in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where anyone can hail a fully driverless car—no safety driver, no steering wheel input, no human control required. Riders are using it every day like a regular Uber or Lyft.

In contrast, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) is still classified as Level 2 autonomy. That means the system can assist with steering, acceleration, and braking, but the driver must be fully alert and ready to take over at all times. Tesla has no regulatory approval to operate a robotaxi fleet, and no Tesla on the road today can legally drive itself.

Waymo uses a sophisticated sensor fusion approach:

* Lidar for detailed 3D mapping
* Radar for object detection in poor visibility
* High-definition maps to understand complex city layouts

Tesla, by contrast, has removed radar and relies exclusively on cameras and neural networks, a vision-only system. While Tesla claims this mimics human driving, it’s also less reliable in poor lighting, bad weather, or unpredictable road scenarios. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles on public roads and released a detailed 2023 safety report showing zero major injuries or fatalities across millions of fully autonomous rides.

Elon Musk has been promising Level 4 or even Level 5 autonomy “next year” since 2016—nearly a decade of delays. As of today, FSD Beta still requires constant supervision. Tesla has not submitted its system to any regulatory body (e.g., DMV or NHTSA) for approval as an autonomous driving platform. No Tesla vehicle qualifies as a robotaxi, and none are legally allowed to operate as such

Tesla can't jump straight to Level 4. It first needs to prove Level 3, where the car can drive itself under limited conditions without driver input—but even that milestone has not been reached. It’s based more on hope and hype than actual technical progress or regulatory reality. Tesla has a powerful brand, and Elon’s ambitious promises get attention—but when it comes to real-world robotaxi deployment, Waymo is years ahead.

Now we can talk about the robot. Boston Dynamics and Tesla’s Optimus are both developing humanoid robots. Boston Dynamic Has been developing humanoid and quadruped robots for **over a decade**. Their humanoid robot, Atlas, can run, jump, do parkour, backflips, and handle complex terrain. Their quadruped robot, Spot, is already being used in real industrial environments—construction sites, factories, even police and research teams.

Tesla first unveiled Optimus in 2021as a concept, with actual development starting in 2022. Still in early prototype stages—Tesla has shown it walking, lifting objects, and folding clothes, but it’s not yet capable of dynamic movement like Atlas. As of 2025, it’s still being tested internally and isn’t commercially deployed.

Boston Dynamics is years ahead in terms of real-world functionality.

I think I’ve looked into this deeply enough to respond to the common claim that “Tesla is more than just a car company.” The truth is, Tesla *was* more than just a car company. It had a bold vision—revolutionizing energy, transportation, and robotics all at once.

But that vision has faded.

Today, Tesla has lost much of its momentum under Elon Musk’s shifting priorities. Right now, it's essentially an overvalued car company that’s trying to break into the robotaxi and robotics space—fields where it's already years, if not a decade, behind the actual industry leaders.

The ambition is still there—but the execution no longer matches the hype.

Now, this isn't to say that Tesla will be going down in the next months or two. I noticed many of the people who are reading the previous post didn't understand what I was talking about when I was talking about LPSY. Specifically, I was referring to the Wyckoff distribution schematic phase c-d LPSY. Phase C is the test. The ‘Test’ serves the same but opposite function as the ‘Spring’ in the accumulation phase: the bull trap before the downtrend. While this level does get broken, it doesn’t change the picture of the cycle. Phase D is the effect. Phase D in this distribution phase is a mirror image of Phase D in the accumulation cycle. There is a considerable surge in volume and volatility, comprising one or more Last Point of Supply (LPSY) points. A Sign of Weakness (SOW) level happens, the final indication that the bears will soon take center stage. You have to open up tradingview or similar program to draw this, but it looks like Tesla is currently in that phase.

[https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/)

The LPSY (Last Point of Supply) is a critical stage in the Wyckoff distribution schematic where rallies begin to fail, unable to reach previous highs. During this phase, we typically expect to see a short-term rally, but it’s often weak and unsustainable. Volume behavior becomes a major red flag—buying volume dries up on the way up, while selling volume increases during pullbacks. This pattern suggests that institutions have already completed their distribution, leaving retail traders to buy the dip, unaware that the “smart money” has exited. As a result, the stock becomes highly vulnerable to a sharp decline.

In Tesla’s case, these signs are already becoming visible. We’re seeing a pattern of lower highs, indicating that each rebound is losing strength. Key support levels are eroding, and momentum is fading, even in response to what would typically be considered “good news.” At the same time, narrative fatigue is setting in—delays in the robotaxi rollout, slowing delivery growth, ongoing price cuts, and Tesla’s recent pullback from expanding its Supercharger network have all contributed to weakening sentiment. All of this points to Tesla potentially being in its LPSY phase, teetering on the edge of a deeper markdown.

One thing we often overlook when talking about Tesla is its status as a luxury brand, which brings us back to the broader conversation about the economy. Before I go any further, I want to be clear: I’m praying that I’m wrong. I don’t *want* the economy to crash. But I’ve lived through a recession before—and I remember it vividly.

Back in 2008, I watched family and friends lose their businesses, homes, jobs, savings—and in some cases, even loved ones. The pain was real. And what made it worse was knowing that much of it happened while our government and institutions downplayed the risks or outright lied to the public. That experience has shaped the way I look at economic data today.

Right now, I believe we're entering a recession—or at the very least, staring down a serious economic slowdown. I'm not writing this to tell you to sell all your stocks or panic. I’m sharing this because I hope you’ll take a step back, assess your risks, and plan accordingly.

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity that is widespread and lasts for more than a few months. It typically shows up in multiple indicators: GDP, personal income, employment, industrial production, and retail sales. There's also a more technical (but less comprehensive) definition: two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the earliest warning signs appeared in November 2007, which the NBER later marked as the official start of the recession. At that time, major financial institutions began reporting huge losses on mortgage-backed securities, job growth slowed, consumer confidence dropped, and the stock market—which had peaked in October 2007—began to decline. Subprime lenders were collapsing, and credit was tightening across the board.

By mid-2008, the crisis accelerated: Bear Stearns collapsed in March, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. Housing prices plummeted, unemployment surged, and the economy spiraled. If you had exited the market in November 2007, you would not have seen the S&P 500 return to the same level until May 2011. That’s 3.5 years of waiting—and that's assuming you had the ability to hold through it all. This matters because knowing when to cut losses can save years of financial recovery, unless you're okay with sitting on those losses for the long haul.

I still remember watching Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, downplay the risks in the housing market and broader economy. Despite clear signs of overheating in credit and housing, he failed to act—ignoring warnings from economists, regulators, and data. That experience is why I don’t place my faith in Jerome Powell or any official narrative. I trust only the numbers.

Looking ahead, the week of March 24–30 will give us key economic data. On Wednesday, we’ll get the Durable Goods Orders report. The forecast is -0.7%, compared to last month’s +3.1%. If it comes in even lower, that’s significant—because durable goods (like cars, appliances, aircraft, and machinery) are only purchased when businesses and consumers feel confident. A steep drop in this number is a classic early warning sign of a recession. However, durable goods alone don’t tell the full story—it needs to be paired with rising unemployment, falling retail sales, and declining industrial production to form a full recessionary picture.

On Thursday, we’ll see the GDP growth rate (QoQ). It was 3.0% in September and 3.1% in December. The projection now is 2.3%. If it misses expectations and drops even lower, we may not officially “ring the recession bell” just yet—but June’s data will become pivotal. That's when things may start to shift into ""oh-shit"" mode.

Then on Friday, we’ll get personal income and personal spending figures. These are crucial. If both decline, that’s another strong recession signal. Personal spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP, and if consumers stop spending, the economy slows—simple as that. Personal income tells us how much financial cushion people have. When both metrics go down, it shows growing financial stress among households.

For the week of March 31–April 6, we’ll get more insight with ISM Services PMI on Thursday, and then non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate on Friday. Forecasts haven’t been released yet, but if these numbers also disappoint—especially in combination with all the metrics above—we’ll be staring at a textbook recession setup. These are the early signs, and I’m laying them out not to scare you, but to prepare you.

You may think I’m being overly cautious, and I could absolutely be wrong. And honestly—I hope I am. But the question you have to ask yourself is: Are you willing to risk losing 50% of your savings just to see if I’m wrong?

Looking back at 2008, throughout most of 2007 and early 2008, the Bush administration repeatedly said the economy was “fundamentally sound,” even as the housing and credit markets collapsed beneath them. In January 2008, President Bush acknowledged “economic challenges” but still refused to call it a recession. And by the time the government acted decisively, it was already too late for millions of families.

This isn’t about being Republican or Democrat. It’s about making sure the words our officials say line up with what the numbers are telling us. If they don’t—we need to learn from history and not fall into the same trap. We can’t afford to get scammed into losing our life savings again.

Let’s circle back to the topic of Tesla as a luxury brand—because that’s an important lens to view its current position through. Do you remember what happened during the 2008 financial crisis? Both automobile sales and luxury goods took a massive hit. Consumers cut back sharply on big-ticket purchases, and the luxury sector—cars, fashion, jewelry, travel—was no exception.

If you haven’t already, take a look at LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. Its stock has dropped significantly, reflecting weakening demand for high-end consumer goods. This is a telling sign. Now ask yourself—what about Airbnb (ABNB)? Another brand that, while not traditionally “luxury,” thrives on discretionary income and consumer confidence. It’s also seeing a decline, which suggests people are pulling back on travel and experiences—another luxury-like behavior.

Then there’s the VIX, the so-called “fear index” that tracks market volatility. If you examine the chart, you’ll notice that it’s starting to resemble the early stages of 2008—with rising spikes and volatility building quietly under the surface.

Some may argue that it also looks like 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a global economic shutdown. But the key difference is that in 2020, the whole world was impacted simultaneously—the pandemic was a shared crisis that brought coordinated government responses, massive stimulus, and a V-shaped recovery.

This time is different. What we’re seeing now is primarily an American problem—rooted in sticky inflation, rising consumer debt, eroding household savings, and waning confidence in domestic institutions and policy. Other countries aren't yet showing the same systemic stress.

So when we talk about Tesla, or any luxury-adjacent brand, we have to recognize that luxury spending is one of the first things to be cut when consumers feel insecure. And the signs—from LVMH to ABNB to the VIX—are stacking up. This isn’t fear-mongering. It’s pattern recognition.

Lastly—and I want to emphasize this—I'm not saying the sky is falling, nor am I predicting that the stock market is going to crash tomorrow. In fact, I actually believe the market may move upward in the short term due to momentum, technicals, or temporary optimism.

However, looking beyond the next few weeks, I believe the economic data over the next six months will begin to confirm what many of us already feel: that a recession is likely on the horizon. In particular, I think the next three months will be the most revealing. The trends we see in that window—whether in job growth, consumer spending, durable goods, or inflation—will be the “tell” that it's time for investors to start protecting their assets and reassessing their positions.

You don't need to sell everything. But you do need to have a plan. Because once the data becomes undeniable, the window to exit cleanly and safely may close fast.

Thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I had planned to dive into other topics, but honestly, there’s so much unfolding right now that it’s hard to keep it all focused. I genuinely feel for those who are still holding on, caught in the sunken cost fallacy, hoping things will bounce back simply because they’ve already lost so much.

Just remember: losing less is always better than losing more. Sometimes survival in the market isn’t about timing the top or the bottom—it’s about knowing when to step aside and preserve what you have.

Instead tsla cars got vandalized and so the market quickly realized the fairytale story for the car company probably wasn’t true. 

The stock is still insanely overvalued. It is up 1000 percent over the last 5 years. But news outlets and reddit posts are all saying its “over” for elon. Really scratching my head here.

1jheaxd,Tesla short thesis and the U.S. market (House of Cards) pending crash,"Hello Fellow Apes (I use this term affectionately—don’t take it too seriously),

I’ve been seeing a flood of posts about Tesla lately, and I’ll admit—I’m feeling the FOMO. But instead of just jumping in impulsively, I wanted to take a step back and explore the broader implications of what’s happening with Tesla and the U.S. market as a whole.

Now, I’m not claiming to have all the answers. In fact, I know that no one person can fully grasp the entire landscape—there are just too many moving parts. That’s exactly why we’re here: to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and grow smarter together. If you think I’ve got something wrong, by all means, correct me—I welcome it.

With that said, I’ll get straight to the point: like many of you, I believe Tesla’s current stock price is inflated beyond what makes sense for a car company. That’s not up for debate in my view. The real question is when it’s going to come back down to earth.

I think some of the hardcore short sellers may have shown up too early to the party. Yes, they’re making noise and causing some damage, but it’s still early days. The key reason? Elon and Trump still have enough firepower—both financial and cultural—to prop this thing up, at least for the short term. Between their loyal fanbases and their connections to wealthy, influential backers, they’re capable of swinging retail sentiment when needed.

From a technical perspective, we also appear to be entering the Last Point of Supply (LPSY) phase in Wyckoff distribution. That’s the stage where the stock experiences one final upward thrust before demand dries up and the markdown phase begins. We won’t be able to confirm this until after the fact, but this setup suggests there may still be one last upswing before reality sets in.

And let’s not forget how easily Elon and Trump can manufacture short-term narratives to keep the hype train rolling. For example:

1. Elon announces a new, cheaper model with an overly optimistic delivery timeline.

2. Trump announces plans to transition the federal vehicle fleet to Teslas.

3. A surprise decision is made to standardize all federal charging stations to Tesla’s NAC.

4. Suddenly, a new mandate appears—every automaker must adopt the NAC standard “by tomorrow.”

5, Tesla remains the only EV maker eligible for tax credits, while competitors lose out.

All hypothetical, of course—but not far-fetched. These kinds of announcements, even if temporary or empty promises, are more than enough to juice the stock price and keep hope alive a little longer.

But here’s the thing: this won’t work in the long run. The brand itself is becoming radioactive. Tesla is quickly approaching the kind of cultural toxicity we associate with names like “Adolf” or the toothbrush mustache. No matter how much mental gymnastics some bagholders perform, you can’t deny the rot underneath. The company has shown no real innovation, has no competitive moat, and has been delivering nothing but negative headlines for months.

1. Tesla's stock has experienced a significant decline of nearly 50% in three months, reducing its market capitalization from an all-time high of $1.5 trillion to $845 billion.

9. In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter.

The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.

Going back to the whole CEO encourage people to not sell their stock, we have many examples in history that tell us this is an ""Oh Shit"" moment.

In September 2001, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay urged employees to buy more Enron shares, reassuring them that the company's upcoming quarterly financial report was ""looking great."" He stated, ""The company is fundamentally sound. At current stock prices... this seems to be an incredibly cheap stock."" Shortly after Lay's assurances, Enron disclosed massive financial losses and accounting irregularities, leading to a rapid decline in stock value. The company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, marking one of the most infamous corporate collapses in history.

In the months leading up to Lehman Brothers' collapse, CEO Richard Fuld and other top executives publicly expressed confidence in the firm's financial stability. Despite these assurances, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, marking one of the largest failures in financial history and a pivotal event in the global financial crisis.

In March 2008, Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz publicly stated that the firm was not facing a liquidity crisis, aiming to reassure investors and employees about the company's stability. Days after these statements, Bear Stearns faced a severe liquidity crunch, leading to its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase at a significantly reduced stock price, highlighting the rapid deterioration of its financial position. We're not there yet, but JPMorgan pt is $120.

Angelo Mozilo, CEO of Countrywide Financial, consistently expressed optimism about the company's prospects amid rising concerns about the subprime mortgage market. Despite Mozilo's positive outlook, Countrywide suffered massive losses due to its exposure to subprime mortgages, leading to its acquisition by Bank of America in 2008 as the financial crisis unfolded.

I’ve lived through enough so-called “once-in-a-lifetime” financial events to know when the market is out of whack—and we are definitely in one of those moments.

Before we zoom out to talk about the broader economy, I want to challenge you to look around your own community. Talk to small business owners. Ask how their foot traffic and revenue are doing. Most will tell you business is down. People simply have less money and are spending less.

You can even see the signs in the everyday stuff:

\- Less traffic on the roads.

\- Empty parking lots where there used to be crowds.

\- Local shops offering more discounts, desperate to get people through the door.

These are the subtle, everyday indicators that the economy is softening—not just in isolated pockets, but everywhere from California to Maine.

And it’s not just consumers—farmers are on the brink. Operating costs are soaring, demand is shrinking, and programs that used to keep them afloat—like USAID—are being cut. Add to that tariffs on our allies, and we’re creating a ripple effect that could drag the entire global economy down with us.

The signs on the macro level are many at the moment. For example, Consumers make up about 70% of U.S. GDP, so when people stop spending, the economy slows down. Lower retail sales, slower restaurant traffic, fewer car purchases, and decreased discretionary spending are all down. Next week. we have durable goods orders, GDP growth rate QoQ, core PCE price index, personal income, and personal spending. 

By definition, a recession is often (though not officially) defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. We won't see this for a while, but by the time we see this, there is no point in me writing this post because I will just be captain obvious. However, the thing we should look for, the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) and Industrial Production reports often show early weakness. A reading below 50 in the PMI signals contraction in the manufacturing sector — a major red flag. As of February 2025, the U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.3, indicating a slight expansion in the manufacturing sector. This reflects a marginal decrease from January's PMI of 50.9.

Looking at unemployment rate, when companies expect slower growth, they lay off workers. If we see an increase in unemployment rate and initial jobless claims, it would fit our thesis that our economy is getting ready to eat shit, and no amount of bullshit will save luxury goods like Tesla from the crash. As of February 2025, the U.S. unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, a slight increase from 4.0% in January.

Another key indicator to watch is the yield curve, particularly when it becomes inverted — a condition that has contributed to the strange and unpredictable market behavior we've seen over the past couple of weeks. A yield curve inversion occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates, most commonly measured by comparing the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Under normal conditions, long-term bonds yield more than short-term ones because of the risks associated with time. But when investors grow pessimistic about the economic outlook, they start buying more long-term bonds (driving those yields down), while short-term rates remain elevated — often due to central bank policy. This reversal in the yield curve is widely interpreted as the bond market signaling a potential economic downturn. Historically, the 2-year/10-year inversion has been one of the most reliable predictors of recessions in the U.S., accurately signaling nearly every major economic downturn since World War II. While I’m not an expert in the mechanics behind this, I’ve been noticing that the recent yield curve dynamics are likely playing a role in the market volatility and erratic swings we've been witnessing. These sharp ups and downs aren’t happening in a vacuum — they're part of a broader pattern of uncertainty and shifting investor sentiment rooted in concerns about future economic health.

Then we have the earnings. When companies begin missing revenue and earnings targets, it can reflect a slowdown in sales and consumer demand. The next few months will be the make-it-or-break-it for the economy. So far, many larger company has been missing their revenue and earning targets--looking at you walmart and target. 

Anyway, that’s just my two cents. A lot of people have been saying that the market is acting irrationally — that the recent swings and volatility don't make sense. But from where I stand, especially when considering the actions of market manipulators and the broader economic indicators, the market actually appears very rational — just not in the way most people expect.

What we’re seeing isn’t chaos without cause; it’s a market reacting to carefully orchestrated narratives, short-term hype, and policy signals. Of course, I also believe that the government and major institutions are doing what they can to project confidence and calm public sentiment, likely to prevent panic selling and maintain a sense of stability. That doesn’t necessarily mean things are fine — it just means they're trying to delay the consequences.

For those of us paying attention, now is the time to really reflect. This moment calls for managing our risks, thinking critically, and planning how we want to move forward in an economy that feels increasingly uncertain. Whether that means reallocating investments, building cash reserves, or reassessing personal and business goals, it’s important we stay proactive rather than reactive.",2025-03-22 17:53:10,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/
1jhe6r8,Tesla’s End-of-Lease Vehicle Accounting: How Falling Resale Values Impact Liabilities (2024-2025),"I recently came across a post discussing Tesla’s leasing model and its implications for the company’s financials. Given the current negative sentiment around Tesla—due to Elon Musk’s controversial actions and statements—I decided to dig into the numbers using Deep Research. One of the biggest concerns right now is **the sharp decline in Tesla’s resale values**, which has significant implications for its leasing business and financial obligations.

# What Happens When Tesla Lease Vehicles Are Returned?

Tesla offers both **direct leases** (where it owns the leased vehicle) and **third-party leases** (where banks own the car, and Tesla guarantees a minimum resale value). When leases end, Tesla either:

1. **Resells the vehicle as a used car** (increasing “Services and Other” revenue).
2. **Releases it for another lease** (keeping it on its balance sheet as an asset).
3. **Buys back the vehicle under resale value guarantees** if a third-party lessor is involved.

# How Tesla Accounts for End-of-Lease Vehicles

1. **Operating Lease Vehicles, Net (Balance Sheet Asset):**
   * As of **December 31, 2024**, Tesla reported **$5.58 billion** in vehicles leased to customers (net of depreciation).
   * This asset declines as Tesla sells off or re-leases vehicles.
2. **Resale Value Guarantees (Potential Liability):**
   * Tesla **guarantees** buybacks for some leases.
   * Their maximum **end-of-lease exposure** under these guarantees **ballooned to $1.45 billion** in late 2024, up from just $166 million in 2023.
   * Despite this, Tesla reported the actual booked **liability as “immaterial”**—which now seems questionable given resale price drops. I expect this to be burred in the next earnings release so I'm keeping an eye on this.

# Tesla’s Resale Value is Crashing—How Does This Affect Liabilities?

Historically, Tesla’s used car prices were strong, allowing them to resell lease returns at a good margin. However:

* **Used Tesla prices plunged \~10-15% YoY**, especially for Model 3 and Y.
* This is due to **increased competition (Rivian, BYD, Hyundai, Ford)**, falling EV demand, and **Musk’s reputation issues driving away some buyers**.
* **Tesla is now selling used cars for LESS than their assumed residual values** in many cases.

# 🚨 Why This is a Big Problem 🚨

1. **Tesla May Need to Take Write-Downs on Leased Vehicles**
   * If actual resale values **drop below Tesla’s estimated residual values**, they have to recognize an **impairment charge** on their books.
   * So far, they’ve **avoided** reporting major write-downs, but Q1/Q2 2025 earnings could reflect this.
2. **Resale Value Guarantees Become Costly**
   * Tesla promised to buy back certain third-party-leased cars at pre-agreed prices.
   * If market values are far lower, **Tesla takes the loss**—this could hit margins hard.
3. **Profitability of the Leasing Model Declines**
   * With resale values falling, leasing becomes **less profitable**, or Tesla is forced to raise lease prices to compensate.
   * Tesla’s financing arm may need to adjust **future lease residual values downward**, which **hurts growth** in this revenue stream.

# What to Watch For in Tesla’s Next Earnings Reports

* **Are they recognizing a provision for lease impairments?**
* **Has the resale value guarantee liability increased?**
* **Are they slowing down new lease originations due to higher residual risk?**

# Final Thoughts

Tesla has gotten away with minimal provisions for lease losses so far, but the reality of **falling resale prices** could force them to take a hit soon. If the used Tesla market doesn’t recover, **expect impairments and higher lease-related losses in 2025**.

This is not financial advice — just a curious Redditor sharing their research. For transparency, I do hold some long puts expiring in September and I’ve been selling weekly puts ahead of earnings while implied volatility is elevated. I don’t necessarily expect this upcoming earnings release to be the catalyst for a major sell-off, but I do think Q2 could look worse if something drastic isn’t done.

1jgj4af,Tesla’s Retail Fans Buy the Stock at a Pace Never Seen Before,"Tesla Inc.’s stock is in a freefall. Its sales are plunging around the world. Even its most avid Wall Street bulls are turning cautious. But one group is buying the electric-vehicle maker’s shares like never before: CEO Elon Musk’s fans.
The company has always had a strong fan-base among individual investors, who hang on Musk’s every word on X, the social-media platform he owns. They analyze Tesla in great detail in online forums, and largely function as a hype crew for the stock.
But their current level of enthusiasm is staggeringly high, even by recent historical standards. Individual investors have been net buyers of Tesla shares for 13 straight sessions through Thursday, pumping $8 billion into the stock, retail trading data from JPMorgan Chase’s global equity derivatives strategist Emma Wu shows. That’s the biggest inflow over any buying streak since 2015, which is as far back as the data goes.

What makes the buying notable is Tesla’s share price has sunk 17% over this time, wiping out more than $155 billion from its market value.
“Tesla made some rookie to mid-stage public market investors extremely wealthy, a lot of people became millionaires because of this stock,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. “People don’t forget that. And they will come back to a stock again and again if they feel it has been beaten up.”
Tesla shares have been on a steep slide since mid-December when it touched an all-time high fueled by optimism from Donald Trump’s election victory. But that euphoria vanished, with the stock retreating more than 50% from its Dec. 17 record, making it the second biggest decliner in the S&P 500 Index this year. The rout has been so brutal that on Thursday Musk sought to reassure Tesla employees during an all-hands meeting, telling them to “hang on to your stock.”

What’s become clear is what Wall Street thought was a bonus for the company, Musk’s prominent role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has become an albatross. His growing political presence and involvement with controversies in Europe have triggered a backlash against the company and its leader, with the cars increasingly seen as political symbols. Protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails at Tesla showrooms, and vandalized charging stations.

The impact is showing up in the company’s financials. Sales of the Tesla’s cars have sunk in key European markets, such as France and Germany, as well as in China and Australia. The US numbers won’t be available until the company reports its first-quarter delivery figures early next month, but analysts across Wall Street have been aggressively cutting their estimates for sales and profits, citing the bleak data from around the globe.

On Thursday, long-time Tesla bull and Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lowered his price target on the stock and reduced his sales expectations for the company citing growing competition, an aging vehicle lineup and a “buyers’ strike from negative brand sentiment.” However, he kept his buy-equivalent rating on the shares, saying the weak near-term expectations are “not particularly narrative changing” for a company whose future depends on robotics and artificial intelligence.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives on Friday lauded Musk’s efforts for “hand holding” employees and investors at a key time, and said that if the CEO continued to lead on his vision the stock will be on a growth path where 90% of its valuation will be led by autonomous driving technology and robotics. This bullishness explains at least some of retail traders’ continuing enthusiasm for the shares.
“These kind of investors don’t care about valuations at all,” Colas said. “They just believe in the future of the company and Elon Musk’s abilities.”

1jg4qgf,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

1jg4o6x,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

""These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,"" Caldwell said.

""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.""

1jfx9en,$UBER: Self Driving King Maker,"“How’s your night been bro?”, “How long you been driving Uber for?”, “can I drink and vape in here?”, these are just some of the things which will slowly disappear as self driving taxis become more and more commonplace. 

BUT, do you know what’s not going to disappear? Uber!

Oh but Waymo will just launch its own ride sharing platform and same with Tesler (the best all computer mode of transportation on the market). This is the counter point we generally hear to Uber’s relevance in the next 10+ years. 

This fails to take into account two things: 
1) Making a self driving car is incredibly difficult until it’s not. 
2) We are 10+ years minimum until full self driving is widespread enough to be a global everyday option.
3) Companies don’t care about monopolies they care about making money and return on investment.

Point 1: Same thing people were saying with Tesla and electric vehicles. First mover advantage, by the time everyone catches up Tesla will be a million miles ahead of everyone. We now see that it’s not that hard once the foundational level tech has been developed and eventually all cars will have an electric vehicle if they want. 

Point 2: We are so far away from full self driving being an everyday part of global life that there is an incredible amount of cash burn still required and companies will compete to make the best self driving car, NOT spending ungodly amounts of money playing 20+ years of catchup on Uber. Keeping in mind that Uber continues to evolve and find new ways to screw their customers (incredibly bullish 🤑)

Point 3: This goes hand in hand with point 2. There is still a tremendous amount of cash burn with self driving car companies such as Waymo and the easiest path to commercialisation is partnering with Uber. They will choose return on investment instead of monopolies every time and we are bringing to see this with Waymo. 

Also good financials, finally profitable, gross bookings up blah blah blah boring.

1jfrju1,Tesla Fair Value,"TL;DR: If Tesla is no longer priced as a fast growing tech company, the P/E should drop to align with the rest of the automotive industry (10-12). That puts the fair value share price around $25. 

Recent data from various sources indicate that the global auto industry P/E ratio typically ranges between 15 and 20 when considering a broad set of companies. However, Tesla's significantly higher P/E ratio—often cited above 100 (161.23 as of March 17, 2025)—skews the industry average upward when included. Excluding Tesla, the average P/E ratio for traditional automakers tends to be much lower, reflecting their more established, slower-growth business models compared to Tesla's growth-oriented valuation.Focusing on major automakers excluding Tesla, here are some representative P/E ratios based on recent data:

* Toyota: Approximately 9.7
* General Motors (GM): Around 9.13
* Ford: About 6.74
* Honda: Around 7.3
* Stellantis: Approximately 6.5
* Volkswagen (VW): Around 4.0
* Hyundai: Approximately 2.9

These figures indicate that traditional automakers have P/E ratios typically in the single digits to low teens. To estimate the average P/E ratio excluding Tesla, we can take a simple average of these representative companies:

* (9.7 + 9.13 + 6.74 + 7.3 + 6.5 + 4.0 + 2.9) / 7 = approximately 6.61

However, broader industry analyses (e.g., from Simply Wall St or Nasdaq) suggest that the U.S. or global auto industry average, when Tesla’s outsized P/E is excluded, typically falls between 8 and 12, depending on the sample of companies and market conditions. The U.S. auto industry's 3-year average P/E is noted at 72.0x, but this is heavily influenced by Tesla; without it, the average drops significantly, aligning closer to the 8-12 range cited. Given the variability and the lack of a single definitive dataset in the provided references, a reasonable estimate based on the data is:

* Average P/E ratio in the automotive industry, excluding Tesla: Approximately 8 to 12, with a midpoint around 10.

This range reflects the lower valuations of traditional automakers, which are less growth-focused than Tesla, and is consistent with current sentiment and comparative financial metrics as of March 20, 2025. For a more precise figure, additional data from a comprehensive set of automakers would be needed, but this range provides a solid approximation based on available information.

Many Tesla shorts and detractors have questioned Tesla’s accounting for years, but they have never gained much traction – until now.
Today, the Financial Times has released a new report pointing to a $1.4 billion gap in assets:

**Compare Tesla’s capital expenditure in the last six months of 2024 to its valuation of the assets that money was spent on, and $1.4bn appears to have gone astray**.”

1jfidz3,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",2025-03-20 06:08:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/

1jzhipc,How bad is this for TSLA?,"Tesla is facing significant pressure to address a major shortfall in its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology.
Approximately 4 million vehicles equipped with the Hardware 3 (HW3) computer- installed in Teslas produced from April 2019 through late 2023-are unable to achieve the promised unsupervised autonomous driving capabilities. This revelation contradicts Tesla's earlier assurances that all vehicles produced since 2016 had ""all the hardware necessary for full self-driving capability.""

In January 2025, CEO Elon Musk acknowledged that HW3 lacks the necessary processing power for full autonomy. He stated that Tesla would need to upgrade the computers in vehicles of customers who purchased the FSD package. This admission has sparked discussions about potential compensation or hardware upgrades for affected owners.

The situation is further complicated by (HW4) computers. In early 2025, Tesla recalled over 200,000 vehicles due to HW4 units short-circuiting, leading to failures in safety features like rearview cameras. The company is addressing these problems through over-the-air software updates and, when necessary, hardware replacements.

Given the scale of the HW3 issue and the costs associated with potential retrofits or compensation, this could become one of the most expensive recalls in automotive history. Tesla has not yet detailed a comprehensive plan for addressing the HW3 limitations across its fleet.

1jxvwyf,"Tesla's Stock Is Set For A ""Death Cross"" On Monday","Tesla's 50-day moving average is about to cross the 200-day, a bearish signal. Meanwhile, vehicle sales are slumping, while the valuation remains high.

Tesla Inc. investors need to ask themselves: How do you price in sentiment?

Chief Executive Elon Musk's involvement in Washington and his leadership role in the so-called Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, have been driving the narrative lately on Tesla's stock $(TSLA)$ - for better or worse.

The stock rallied in the final quarter of 2024, running up by 120% between late October and mid-December, partly on a strong sales outlook and partly because of Musk's closeness to President Donald Trump. Investors hoped his ties to the administration would be positive for Tesla.

Now, though, those ties have become a liability for the electric-vehicle maker. People are vandalizing Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars driven by its customers. Even those who aren't actively boycotting the brand may be deterred from owning a Tesla right now.

The company is heavily consumer-facing. About 77% of its revenue comes from consumer vehicles, and Tesla also sells energy products to consumers. So brand sentiment and its impact on sales matters. The truth is, very few high-profile brands have seen backlash and political boycotts to the degree Tesla is now experiencing.

Bud Light serves as one example, but to a lesser extent. Following an April 2023 boycott of Bud Light, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's (BE:ABI) stock tumbled by about 16% in a little over a month. Sales for Bud Light haven't recovered. So gauging the fallout from backlash against Tesla ahead of its future earnings could be difficult.

Bob Lang, founder and chief strategist at Explosive Options, suggests turning to soft data to try and determine how consumers feel about the brand. A survey by YouGov from March showed that 37% of respondents said that Musk is either part of or wholly the reason they wouldn't consider owning or leasing a Tesla.

What does the data tell us about Tesla's stock?

Its technicals look rough

If you're a trader, you could probably resort to an endless number of indicators to gauge short term moves. But for longer-term investors, the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages matter because they show long-term trends.

As of Friday morning, Tesla was near the ""death cross"", which is when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, a bearish signal.

""Why is that significant? It means that big institutional money is going to think twice about buying below this after the crossover is done,"" Lang said.

Below is a chart from FactSet that shows the near cross of the 50-day moving average to the 200-day moving average as of Friday's close. At current rates, the 50-day can cross over the 200-day on Monday.",2025-04-13 00:53:25,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jxvwyf/teslas_stock_is_set_for_a_death_cross_on_monday/

1jw5e1w,Tesla Skyrockets Over 22% In A Single Day: Massive dual blast from the ERDF annihilates bears.,"Well... It's time for a little self-deprecating humility and humor. 

Position: I am short on Tesla (still). Yesterday sucked.

In two of my previous posts on r/stocks ""**Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.**"" and **""Forbes: ""Elon Musk's pet project- the dumpster driving Tesla Cybertruck..."" is one of biggest flops in automotive history.**"" I shared my ever growing conspiracy theory predicting the downfall of Tesla based on three things:

1. The ERDF.
2. Unscrupulous accounting that cloaks poor performance.
3. And the downfall of Tesla will eventually be caused by the human element.

Here is how it went down and what we can all learn:

Yesterday, after seeing the ego-fueled feud breaking out between Elon and Navarro (predictable), I desperately continued to search the deep, dark corners of the internet looking for anything to feed my confirmation bias in an attempt to make myself feel better about taking such a risky short position. Then it happened. Just what I was looking for. At **10:06am**, it is announced by Eletrek that Tesla's Director of Accounting Controllership, Harsh Rungta, is leaving the company:

Source: [Tesla’s top financial controller leaves (TSLA) ](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-top-financial-controller-leaves-tsla/)

I think: ""*This is it. It's finally happening!*"". All the pieces are fitting together. Not only is does this fit with my zany prediction (a key person leaving from the accounting side), Harsh Rungta is a former PwC guy (Tesla's independent accounting firm), so he probably has buddies inside that are telling him to jump ship before it sinks. I throw on my tinfoil hat, lick my lips, and wait for the stock to start dropping. 

**10:10am:** Sinister looking faceless people in black downhill bicycle racing helmets wearing gloves start pulling levers and pushing illuminated buttons. The bears don't know it yet- but we are doomed.

**Soon thereafter- ERDF Blast #1 goes off:** My news feed starts getting hit with reports of Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh reiteraterating his ""outperform"" rating. A rating solely based on the same old tired and empty promises of the same old ripped-off concepts of future vaporware that will turn Tesla into ""not-a-car-company"" (some day), while lowering his massively inflated target price to something appearing slightly more sane to insane people. All the while, conveniently downplaying all the rising competition, trade war implications, and brand destruction happening in plain sight (per usual for these analysts). 

\*Shit- not looking good now\*

**1:18pm:** A second massive blast from the ERDF is released by Trump on Truth Social, announcing a 90-pause in the tariffs. But not for China. They are getting hit with a 125% increase and escalation to escalate the trade-war. (But that doesn't matter. Even though it really does). 

**1:20pm:** The ERDF generates a massive disturbance in the Force (aka- the stock market). Millions of bears suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. *Something terrible has happened.*

What did we learn? Two important things:

1. Headlines beat undercurrents every time. 
2. The ERDF has grown more powerful than anything anyone could have ever imagined. 

For those that want to know: The ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"", or ERDF, is a real thing that I completely made up to make you laugh. 

**The ERDF- What it is and how works:** The EDRF is a headline generating and hype boosting force with unparalleled power. It can use it's force to pull in suckers from all over the world with a single blast and get them to dump money into Tesla stock. It can be used to elevate meme stocks and keep them going up regardless of reality. It is so powerful, that even smart people who understand it's power but don't believe in the company will invest in Tesla stock, knowing there is an endless supply of suckers (and maybe short sellers to squeeze). 

First, it was just Elon capturing the imaginations of people with his vision of a high tech, sporty, eco-friendly, EV with his theatrical stage shows (back when everyone thought he was cool). Then, it grew into something with the power of a Star Destroyer fleet after Elon made a massive (but deliberate) investment to acquire Twitter and change it to X. Now, X is a gargantuan social media platform of purchased/hijacked users which has been transformed into a massive Elon-only-world-view amplifier for the ERDF (i.e., it is highly censored to fit his narrative). Then it grew into a force as strong as a Death Star surrounded by a fleet of Star Destroyers when Elon and Trump pulled a Voltron and combined forces as POTUS and owners of two separate social media companies. Elon would like to use his ERDF to reshape the entire world in his own image now. And sadly, for us mortals, the force of the ERDF has indeed taken over the entire world.

\*Except Wisconsin. The odor of cheese is the only thing that can repel the ERDF and muskrats are terrified of badgers. Coincidence? I think not...

I find the timing of analysts reiterating the same bullish ratings, news, fake news, and social media posts more than a little suspicious. We all know we are being jerked around but the magnitude of swings all this is causing is ridiculous. The markets were tested to see how they would react to a pause in tariffs with fake news, numbers were crunched, then it happened for real. 

Both Trump and Elon openly grift on crypto and I see this as a continuation of a behavior pattern that has worked for them in the past, just using the stock markets. And they aren't even trying to hide their conflicts of interest anymore. Owning your own social media company, where you, as the POTUS, post news releases that create massive, record-breaking intraday swings in the global markets based on reckless, off-the-cuff decisions you are making on the fly, thereby boosting the number of users on your platform by offering an exclusive source of information that has massive and immediate impact on the largest and fastest flows of money in the entire history of the world, is just a slight conflict of interest don't you think? *\*I used 7-commas in that run-on sentence.* 

The thing I find most interesting, is many of the companies that shot waaaaay up (e.g., Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, etc.) should have been completely hammered with the announcement of tariff increases on China. All of these companies have manufacturing and supply chains that are heavily dependant on China and the trade war with them is only escalating. Tesla got a double boost yesterday during all the madness when it should have been a double whammy. As explained by one person that gets paid to write about such matters: 

""*I say I’m not sure why Tesla also surged on this news, but it’s mainly because it’s a meme stock now. It doesn’t really trade on its actual earnings potential.*

*Also, Tesla shareholders appear to be clueless about what’s happening.*""  

(Source: [Tesla (TSLA) surges on Trump announcing bigger tariffs on China that will destroy its energy business](https://electrek.co/2025/04/09/tesla-tsla-surges-trump-bigger-tariffs-on-china-destroy-energy-business/))

As wiser Obi-Wan Kenobi-like Redditors have warned on my previous posts: ""Stay away from Tesla. It's a meme stock."" They know and respect the power of the ERDF. And as Elon himself has said: ""*There is a large graveyard filled with my enemies. I do not wish to add to it, but will if given no choice.*"" He's not wrong when it comes to short sellers . Also remember: Porkins didn't survive the attack on the Death Star. This next wave of shorties probably won't either. But if fundamentals, actual product sales, brand destruction, and real numbers start mattering to Tesla, the ERDF might come down. That is our only hope.

1jroid1,Market downturn trigger?,"I scrolled a little bit, and most of what i am seeing on the sub is about tarrifs. Is anyone talking about the impact the downturn of TSLA may have had in precipitating the overall market event? 

I don't currently have access to the information, but i would imagine that a sudden - truly unexpected - drop in a blue chip value stock like TSLA would cause an institutions balance sheet to become very lopsided. I'm thinking the current sell off is due to deleveraging against short positions.

Tarrifs are ugly... political and civil unrest - sure... a bit scary, but that seems to have been fuel to the fire as the match was being lit.

Check my thoughts -  but I truly think EM may have gaffe'd the biggest gaffe that has ever been gaffed. Yes, no? Teslas market cap is down close to half a trillion dollars. That is huge.

While I see where the logic for these explanations is coming from, I think there is a very real chance that the true explanation is that **Trump's tariffs are a political weapon, designed to give him leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.** By instituting tariffs, rather than just threatening them, now the clock is ticking: countries, industries, and companies are frantically trying to figure out what to do.     
  
Think about it: first, Trump went after universities, threatening to withhold funding unless they caved to his demands about diversity and pro-Palestinian protestors. This has already forced major institutions, like Columbia, to bend the knee to him.  
  
Then, Trump went after big law firms and their clients, threatening through Executive Orders to cut off their access and intimidate them. This has already resulted in major law firms (Paul Weiss and Skadden) to forge ""settlements"" to do free pro bono work to the President's bidding, though luckily some of these firms (Perkins Coie) have had the integrity to fight back and sue.   
  
Following this logic, it follows that Trump with his tariffs doesn't legitimately believe what he is telling the public about his intentions. Far more likely, I think, that he is using these tariffs to force pledges of loyalty, concessions, and ""deals"" with countries, industries, and companies. 

This is not my original idea, to be fair; I heard it from U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D - Connecticut). He has pointed out that democratically-elected leaders turned despot/authoritarian/fascist will use tools like this to maintain power. Trump knows he cannot be reelected due to term limits, so how does he hold on to power? Like this. It is a slippery slope towards becoming a dictator. 
 
I can only hope that some countries/industries/companies see through this B.S. and fight back, but it is likely that many—now that their finances are being hurt—will bend the knee. 

Going back to the common explanations for Trump's tariffs, here are my counterarguments:    

1. If this was intended to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A., that doesn't make a lot of sense. Companies aren't just going to upend decades of supply chains to invest billions into a country whose people don't want a lot of dirty, hard-work manufacturing jobs, especially when everything could (likely) revert back when Trump is out of office in 4 years.   
2. I won't pretend to be an economist, but a big reason for the trade imbalances is because Americans like buying stuff from XYZ countries. That isn't those countries' fault, necessarily. And moreover, the chart Trump showed at the White House Rose Garden this week did not accurately reflect the actual tariff rates that foreign countries place on the U.S.A—it included trade imbalances, which makes zero sense and is highly misleading, if not an outright lie.   
3. Trump may appear dumb, but he has scores of well-planned sycophants from groups like the Heritage Foundation (Project 2025 authors) that are advising him. It is highly unlikely that they planned so much of his presidency, but the tariffs themselves were an afterthought.   
  
Now granted, we have heard rumors that the tariffs were hastily put together, and that Trump's team may have used ChatGPT to write some of the policy out. At first, this appears to support explanation no. 3. However, I think the hasty nature of these tariff policies actually supports the idea that they are purely intended as political weapons: it doesn't matter what exactly the tariffs are, what matters is creating immediate leverage.   
  
Curious for the community's thoughts. 

Disclosure: I have divested heavily from the U.S. markets and gone into EU stocks, especially defense. I am also short TSLA, DJT, and Air Canada.

**EDIT:** As seeming proof of this theory, American journalist Kara Swisher [reported on BlueSky today](https://bsky.app/profile/karaswisher.bsky.social/post/3llynh6uoyk2z) that ""Several sources tell me a passel of high profile tech and also finance leaders is making a trip to Mar-a-Lago to read Trump the riot act — um talk common sense — to him on the tariffs. Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions in losses.""  
  
Translation, I think: executives are bending over backwards to try and get concessions from Trump. This shows he has leverage over them already.",2025-04-04 15:20:29,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jreh6b/cmv_trumps_tariffs_are_political_weapons/

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[ reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html) the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India — all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important [production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[ like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP. [So if this tips us into recession, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",2025-04-03 18:13:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

if you still think elon is running tesla, you're delusional. tesla makes money from cars, not some fantasy robotaxis or humanoid robots that are nowhere near real. the guy is too distracted trying to be a political influencer instead of fixing his sinking brand.

tesla in 2022 could sell any car they make  at any price. now? they're slashing prices and still struggling. cybertruck owners have to worry about their cars getting vandalized because the brand is toxic. it's not just the usa—he's managed to turn europe and the uk against tesla too. if china weren’t so cut off, he’d probably have tanked that market as well.

there are plenty of smart people who could run tesla better, but elon has the board in his pocket, so there's no real accountability

News: [Trump Weighing Tariff Options As Rose Garden Event Nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/trump-weighing-tariff-options-as-rose-garden-event-nears)

# Trump speaks at the Rose Garden at 4PM EST today- be on the lookout for incremental headlines or anything that is passed on from his admin.

[**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d), [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d), [**PDD (Pinduoduo)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d), [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d) \- China is restricting domestic companies from investing in the U.S. This is significant news in that it's a ""warning shot across the bow"" from China; they're slowly starting to escalate in response to Trump's potential tariffs coming out later today. A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,

[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).

No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",2025-04-02 13:15:56,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpoamx/interesting_stocks_today_042/
1jpo69r,"Tesla reports 336,000 vehicle deliveries in first quarter","Tesla reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company’s stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000
* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000

Investors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla’s investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.

In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

Tesla doesn’t break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454 of its most popular Model 3 and Model Y cars and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.

The company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.

During the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.

CEO Elon Musk recently said during an all-hands session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the “best-selling car on Earth again this year.” 

But Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk’s political rhetoric and his work as part of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

After spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he’s slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.

Musk, the world’s wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February’s elections. Tesla’s business on the continent is struggling.

Across 15 European countries, Tesla’s market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla’s market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.

Tesla shares sank 36% in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.

1jpicww,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Hidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",2025-04-02 06:47:15,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/

Stifel cited the rollout of the new Model Y (Juniper) and growing negative sentiment toward CEO Elon Musk as key factors impacting the company’s outlook.”

News: [US Stock Futures Tumble Ahead Of New Trump Tariffs: Markets Wrap ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/us-stock-futures-tumble-ahead-of-new-trump-tariffs-markets-wrap)

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) , larger tech stocks - ""Liberation day"" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). 

Overall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). 

**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. 

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d) \- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term.

1jngg3e,Challenging the Noise: A Closer Look at Tesla's Q1 Projections,"As we have all seen, there are a ton of headlines about Tesla's (TSLA) declining sales numbers, and it's honestly a bit overwhelming. Here's a quick breakdown of what I gathered:

* Europe sales are reportedly down by 45%
* China sales have decreased by either 49% or 29%
* Australia sales are down by 65.5%

\^\^ keep in mind there are a ton of articles and headlines on this, I picked from a few \^\^

With all these headlines, it's tough to figure out what timeframes they're talking about. Is it one day, one week, three months? Who knows?

Amidst all this noise, I decided to dig deeper into what we should actually expect. While analysts' projections aren't great, they don't seem as grim as the headlines suggest.

**Global Tesla Sales (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 386,810 units
* **2025 Initial Projections**: 412,000 units (median of 398K-426K range, which would've been a 6.5% increase)
* **2025 Current Projections**: 377,000 units (a 2.5% decrease from Q1 2024)
* **Projection Change**: Initial to current projections dropped by 8.5%

**USA Sales Breakdown (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 140,187 vehicles
* **2025 Current Projection**: 138,867 vehicles
* **Change**: Only a 0.9% decrease in the US market

These numbers don't look great, especially for a company like Tesla that's all about growth. But we're still talking about single-digit declines quarter-over-quarter, assuming the analysts are somewhat correct.

I wanted to understand what the Q1 report might reveal because, going by the headlines, it seemed like it would be terrible. But after digging in, it doesn't seem as bad as it feels. Is it just me?

What do you all think? Could the market react less harshly on Q1 review day than the news is making it out to be?",2025-03-30 16:37:34,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jngg3e/challenging_the_noise_a_closer_look_at_teslas_q1/
1jlvzdl,TSLA - Premliminary Tesla registration numbers from March 2025 in Europe.,"Someone (in [r/RealTesla](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/)) posted a table of preliminary registration numbers for a few European countries. In some countries like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, they are down by aprox 60-70% in March 2025 compared to last year  (March 2024), even after Model Y changeover has finished.

In Norway, Tesla is once again the best seller, but it's still down by around 20% from March 2024, and the Q1 total is down around 30%.

There is currently no supply shortage, since you can order a new Model Y Juniper and get delivery almost the same day. The source for the numbers were taken from this website: [https://eu-evs.com/](https://eu-evs.com/)

One country had an increase in sales 25% (Spain).

Overall for the countries listed it was down est around 36%.

[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d) **-** Reported earnings, EPS of $0.29 vs $0.08 expected. EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen’s meeting with Strategy’s chairman. **This is a massive catalyst** solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.

**Related Tickers:** MSTR, COIN

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada’s EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).

[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-** DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.

**Related Tickers:** DG

[**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- New energy rules in China disqualify NVDA's exportable H20 chip, threatening near-term revenue from a key market. Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China’s energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on

1jjvzui,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

Wood told Bloomberg that she expects Tesla’s robo taxis to be the company’s biggest value driver in the next five years, and that the share price was not even factoring in Tesla’s plans for humanoid robots.

Wood’s forecast predicts Tesla’s valuation at nearly 10 times from current levels, as the EV maker grapples with a severe drop in valuation over the past four months. The $2,600 forecast has been touted by Ark in the past. 

Tesla is the biggest component of Wood’s flagship ARK Innovation (NYSE:[ARKK](https://www.investing.com/etfs/ark-innovation)) exchange-traded fund, which holds about $646 million worth of shares in the EV maker. Tesla is also by far Ark’s biggest holding across its other ETFs, according to data from Cathie’s Ark. 

Tesla is trading down nearly 27% so far in 2025, having lost as much as 50% of its value since November.

1jiqjct,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.

News: [US Treasuries Fall on Signs That Trump Will Dilute April Tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/us-treasuries-fall-on-signs-that-trump-will-dilute-april-tariffs)

This has resulted in a market bounce and overall means that markets will likely NOT be as impacted by tariffs as they were expecting. 

The tariff game Trump is playing reminds me of that scene from the office: ""You have no idea the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person! Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!"" -Michael Scott. 

Anyway back to the watchlist. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs—interested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more.

1jinzxp,TSLA: Tesla to roll out full self-driving in China after software approval,"# Tesla halts driving-assistance software trial in China, pending approval

By ReutersMarch 24, 202511:30 AM GMT+1

BEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) said on Monday it would release its smart driving-assistance feature in China after completing regulatory approval, following complaints that a limited-time free trial of its Full Self-Driving service had been temporarily paused.""All parties are actively advancing the relevant process and we will push it to you as soon as it is ready. We are also looking forward to it, please wait patiently,"" Tesla's customer support said on social media platform Weibo.

1ji0n3r,"Tariffs, DOGE and Columbia — The market will crash because Trumpism is not capitalism","There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn’t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It’s half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can’t, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations. 

The cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don’t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I’m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples. 

I have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration. 

TSLA was one of last year’s magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk’s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk’s popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump’s continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market. 

Finally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he’s making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck. 

Trumpism is government regulation on steroids.   ",2025-03-23 14:35:01,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ji0n3r/tariffs_doge_and_columbia_the_market_will_crash/

Whats the big deal?,"Every other news outlet is talking about the Tesla “crash” etc etc. But all I am seeing is that it got an insane boost from the election (basically doubled after Trump got elected) because everyone assumed being Trumps right hand man would do wonders for TSLA. Instead tsla cars got vandalized and so the market quickly realized the fairytale story for the car company probably wasn’t true. 

The stock is still insanely overvalued. It is up 1000 percent over the last 5 years. But news outlets and reddit posts are all saying its “over” for elon. Really scratching my head here.

1jhg8n8,Honest question from long term investor,"I’ve been a long term investor for decades. I’m in solid stocks including the M7. My question, “Should I pull out of at least my M7 (already cashed out TSLA) from the market to cash and reenter well after April 6th?”  So at this point I’m up on all my long term stocks ranging from 39% to 167% as I’ve been is a long time. So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I’m also near retirement age so I don’t have 20 years to wait for a correction. 
Let me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I’m fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD’s near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly. 
But I can’t make a misstep. My portfolio will be 1/2 of the income I will rely on for income in a few years. 


I know we are not supposed to make rash decisions based on “feelings” but it’s more than that, I’m reading nonstop everything about this market and as an older person I feel like I’m seeing a potential 2008 all over again. I wisely went cash then. And in 2010 bought my house for only  42% of it was valued in 2006. Now it’s worth 5 times what I paid for it.

1jg4qgf,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven — which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) — is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

1jg4o6x,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

""These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,"" Caldwell said.

""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.""

1jfidz3,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump’s latest trade policies are hammering the markets—S&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%—and it looks like he’s doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he’s backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

✅ **Tariffs as leverage** – forcing trade partners into more “reciprocal” deals

✅ **USMCA review (2026)** – questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

✅ **Hardline stance on China** – blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**—all of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting—some stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump’s protectionist approach. Trump’s tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump’s strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they “improve border security” and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can’t plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",2025-03-20 06:08:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**News:** [**Turkish Police Detains Erdogan Rival Ekrem Imamoglu**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-19/turkish-police-detains-erdogan-rival-ekrem-imamoglu)

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\- TSMC board member Paul Liu has dismissed rumors regarding TSMC's potential acquisition of INTC's foundries, stating that such discussions have never occurred within the company. Overall caused a small selloff in INTC but nothing major- recently the more major catalyst was the new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The market mainly considered this a rumor so interesting to see it still cause a small move. Overall not too interested unless we sell off more. TSM's clear denial of interest in acquiring INTC's foundries shows that they're not really interested in bringing more production to the US or really partnering with a US solution. Overall more of a interesting geopolitical note.

TSMC news came from Digitimes (a daily industry newspaper from Taiwan on the semicondcutor industry)

[**TUR (Turkey ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TUR&p=d)\- The arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent rival to President Erdoğan has led to a significant selloff in the Turkish lira and Turkish assets. We've fallen close to 10% overnight in TUR, the Turkey ETF. Overall this likely won't see recovery for a few months. Last coup I remember was back in 2016 and it took a few months for TUR to recover (and it didn't do so linearly) so ultimately not interested in this. Continued political unrest and potential sanctions could further devalue Turkish assets, but I doubt there will be any outside intervention. EEM (the emerging markets ETF) seems to be unaffected overall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) **-** California's Public Utilities Commission has granted TSLA a transportation charter-party carrier permit, allowing the company to transport employees in company-owned vehicles, marking a step towards potential public ride-hailing services. The first piece of good news in a while for this stock. Overall I don't think it's good enough to make it have a significant recovery but interested to see if we make any gains today. Watching $235 level. Another step towards self-driving! Risks to watch on this piece of news and blowback are regulatory hurdles, public safety concerns, the overall political risks with TSLA, other self-driving competitors.

1jetgkm,Tesla gets first in a series of permits it needs to run robotaxis in California,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - Tesla [(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O) on Tuesday received the first in a series of approvals from California required for the electric car maker to eventually launch a promised robotaxi service in the state, according to a state regulator.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said it approved Tesla's application for a [transportation charter-party carrier permit](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeking-approval-offer-ride-hailing-services-california-bloomberg-news-2025-02-27/) (TCP), a license typically associated with chauffeur-operated services, allowing the company to own and control a fleet of vehicles and transport employees on pre-arranged trips.

The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk/) pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the [Cybercab](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/), a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.

1jeqaup,Trump’s Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I’m Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I’ve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves—25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy—echo his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

• **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed’s job harder.

• **China’s response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**—this could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

• **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it’s still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here’s how I’m positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** – Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** – “America First” likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** – If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** – If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** – Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** – Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** – Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** – If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I’m watching:**

📌 Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

📌 Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

📌 Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

📌 Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I’d love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump’s Trade War 2.0?",2025-03-19 05:55:08,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/

BYD has unveiled its Super e-Platform, capable of charging an electric vehicle to achieve 400 kilometers (approximately 249 miles) of range in just five minutes. This technology will debut in the upcoming Han L sedan and Tang L SUV models set to launch in April. Negative bias. We're down close to 50% since post-election highs and we've had even more bad news yesterday due to the video showing the limitation of non-LIDAR cars. Unless we see some Hail Mary throw from Elon and Trump or a massive dump in the near future, I'm not interested in going long this stock. Maybe a day trade for any spike down, but not a multi-day swing long.

The patient experienced acute liver failure, a known potential side effect of the therapy. Worth noting that SRPT made roughly $180M in quarterly revenue from this drug, clearly a significant amount for a company that generates $638M net product revenue a quarter. (\~30%!) Interested in going long if we see a larger selloff. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d) \- Announced a proposed offering of 5 million shares of its Series A Preferred Stock.  This is an attempt to raise capital without diluting common stock (what we all typically trade). Still a bearish signal, negative bias.

Overall, another sign the EV market in China will dominate. Despite being unprofitable, they are reaching more cars sold and are expanding for growth (something that no EV company in the US has managed to do **at scale** except for TSLA). The EV market in China is obviously more competitive than in the US so they're not out of the woods yet for the long term.

1jc36c5,Tesla stock declines could cost Elon Musk something important,"Snippet from this article:”After a slight rebound earlier this week, Tesla's TSLA stock is back to falling, keeping with its recent performance. Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn’t done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA has lost its previous momentum and isn’t showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company’s questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. 

Musk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

Saw these move mainly due to recession fears and the entire market panicking, MASSIVE move yesterday.

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.

CEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades.

1j7zm8c,Why the 2025 Bear Market is the real deal & only just getting started,"When it comes to recent major market corrections, the largest drops have coincided with the loosening of interest rates. There have been market corrections outside of these periods, however, those events are significantly lesser in scope compared to the current analog situations of 2000, 2008, and 2020. 

The Fed Funds rate was held at 6.5% from June 2000 to December 2000. It was 5.25 from July of 2006 to July of 2007. It was 2.4 between January of 2019 and July of 2019. 

As the Fed began cutting rates, in each situation, the market began to decline. However, it was during these declines that illiquidity events took place, causing major panic, and subsequent cratering of markets. 

The 1-point decline in interest rates from peak coincides with February 2001, December 2007, and November of 2019. Each respective recession officially began in March of 2001, December of 2007, and February 2020. 

We hit 1-point below peak in January. There is a strong possibility we are ALREADY in recession, however, genius economists will only tell us this in a year or two. 

In any case, each of these recessions coincided with feat contagion and general panic. Each of these events also bottomed after major catastrophes - in 2000 it was 9/11 and Enron, in 2008 it was Lehman + subprime crisis, in 2019 it was.... that horrible thing that we no longer talk about. 

We are already in the fear stage of the market. 2000's panic was a general meltdown PRIOR to the crises that later unfolded. However, it was those crises that marked its bottom. 2008 and 2020's craterings occurred simultaneous to their crises although stocks did drift down prior to 2008 as well. 

This begs the question: what is the crisis that may or may not occur with the cyclical correction that happens as the Fed cuts rates EVERY cycle? Will it be a true black swan no-one saw coming (9/11) or will it be something like Enron, Lehman, or COVID, where some DID see what was coming ahead of the general panic?

Could TSLA be the Enron of the 2025 bust? It is seeming more and more plausible with each passing day. In any case, the bottom of the market in each of the aforementioned cases occurred simultaneous to the Fed funds rate hitting 0 (or almost 0 in 2003). I expect shelter contribution to CPI to vanish in the next few reports + unemployment to rise significantly, this could give the Fed leeway to put rates back to 0 as soon as Q3-Q4 2025. In both 2009 and 2020 the Fed rate hit 0 when annualized CPI did the same (in March), and March of both years also coincided with their respective market bottoms. 

TLDR; we are far from the bottom, which should occur when Fed Funds hit 0, buy when that happens but before that point, gird your loins.",2025-03-10 14:16:06,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7zm8c/why_the_2025_bear_market_is_the_real_deal_only/

1j7l0bv,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653 Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it’s an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Christer Gardell warned that **Tesla’s stock could crash by 95%, citing severe overvaluation and growing market backlash.**

Concerns include slowing sales, especially in key markets like Germany, where registrations fell by 76%, and the U.S., with a nearly 6% drop in February. 

The backlash is partly fueled by Elon Musk’s controversial political affiliations, which have alienated Tesla’s traditional liberal customer base. 

Broader market volatility, ongoing tariff uncertainties, and a general perception that Tesla’s valuation is unsustainable have intensified bearish sentiment against the company.",2025-03-09 06:55:24,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j71yf0/christer_gardell_a_swedish_billionaire_and_hedge/

1j43x5l,These are the stocks on my watchlist (03/5) - Trump's Speech Dissect,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Today is mostly related to Trump's speech yesterday. Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday ""Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow"", so will be on the lookout for that.

News: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)**,** [**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

After an analyst posted a prediction that Tesla would increase its profits by 256%, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded

>It will require outstanding execution, but I think more like 1000% gain for Tesla in 5 years is possible.

The comment was quickly propagated by Elon fans and the community of “Tesla all-ins” as being a sign that Musk, who is quite busy with X and DOGE lately, still believes in Tesla.

Tariffs are here.

News: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. 

**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

**NVDA earnings today, will likely decide the fate of the immediate market. It reports at 4:20 ET today!**

News: [China Plans To Start Bank Capital Hike With At Least 55 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/china-plans-to-start-bank-capital-hike-with-at-least-55-billion)

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Related Tickers:** INTC, QCOM, ASML

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China’s six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

1iya4oj,What are stocks that will benefit from the Trump chaos?,"If what Elon and Trump are doing now continues to be bad for the markets, what are specific sectors/countries that will benefit? What's a good buy if I'm very negative on the current direction of the US?

Moving money from the US to foreign markets may be smart, but which? And a crash in the US tends to affect the entire world, so while they'd probably be safer, they won't be safe.

I pulled out of the US markets entirely last week before the 4 down days. I just put 1/3 of my portfolio into EUAD which is an ETF of some of the biggest European defense stocks.  I know I'm a few months late on this one. Europe is realizing that it can't count on the US anymore and will have to grow its own defense industry. I'm definitely willing to investigate and invest in smaller defense stocks too. I don't expect it to go nuts, because these are old established companies and their stocks don't move that fast, but I think it's a very safe bet that Europe's defense stocks are going to grow over the next few years.

What are some other examples of trying to adjust to the current situation? Short TSLA? Invest in other EV companies that take some of the post-TSLA hype? What industries/ETFs represent the best bet for the trade the US loses if it starts implementing tariffs again?

1ixcnn1,SHALL WE PLAY A GAME? (I love the 80s..and we are headed back!),"When I say that phrase I hear it in the movie computer voice.  Anyway, I vaguely remember the stock market crash of 1987.  I was young but I used to play a stock trading game on my “IBM Compatible” computer which really wasn’t but that is how they sold you computers back then.  It had a ticker that would scroll across the screen and you could buy and sell stocks in made up companies.

No one really knows where the stock market is heading the rest of the year but I could make a pretty good argument we are moving towards stagflation temporarily.  I can see a scenario of a weakening economy with persistent inflation.  So, if the market were to move negative the rest of the year, what are your picks to see the largest downside moves?

My picks:

TSLA - Obvious reasons…its stock prices is built on a dream that is becoming a nightmare
PINS - Low revenue growth outside the U.S, ADU growth slowing down, It is mostly ads now and almost unusable. 25B market came to 3.5B revenue.
SNAP - 11 years in and still can’t make a profit.  

Also, if federal grant money really does decline, and cuts to Medicaid, pick any public health care stock and buy puts.  If they cancel infrastructure contracts, pick most of the shovel companies like Caterpillar and buy puts.  If they cancel the farmer subsidies, buy puts in John Deere.  So many others that are going to be hurt.

So what is your pick for the largest declining stock of 2025 between 2/25 and 12/31?  ",2025-02-24 20:52:28,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ixcnn1/shall_we_play_a_game_i_love_the_80sand_we_are/

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

1isn9yb,Portfolio Advice - 30yo and married,"Hey everyone, love this sub. I been working on rebalancing my portfolio and would love some thoughts - I primarily trimmed down my single stock picks into ETFs. 

I’m 30 and my wife is 27 - we have a NW of about 800K across brokerage and retirement accounts. 

Our breakdown is as follows across that 800K: 

- Vanguard ETFs (VOO/VGT): 567K (70%)
- TSLA: 100K (12.5%) 
- SOFI: 48K (6%)
- PLTR: 35K (4.3%)
- PYPL: 16K (2%)

- Cash + Gold: 30K

I recently trimmed down about half of both my TSLA and PLTR positions, and moved them into VOO/VGT. Feeling a lot better/safer with that decision, but would love some thoughts. I know TSLA is pretty hated on Reddit, but I do believe in their FSD and roadmap for the next few years.

1iq3s4q,How Musk is using TSLA as a piggy bank,"Everyone knows it is a meme stock. By definition it would crash at some point. The trick is to make money while not ending up being the bag holder when it crashes.

But the stock won’t crash unless Musk starts selling. And he knows it too. So he is using the meme stock and meme coins as collateral to invest in real companies that actually have some realistic valuation. 

Musk sold $8.5 billion in Tesla shares to buy Twitter. The stock went down. He basically converted the meme stock to a real company. The banks underwrote that investment suffered losses but he used Twitter to buy the presidency. The banks lost money but gained favors like less regulations instead. Everyone is happy.

He contracts out TSLA stuff to his private companies like xAi.  XAi and Optimus have huge conflicts of interest. Both of them need the best AI talents. My guess is Optimus will end up being the hardware side of the business(nuts and bolts assembly) while the software and IPs will belong to XAi. And for every robot sold, there will be a license paid to XAi. If the board removes Musk, the licensing fee will go up making TSLA side of the business virtually worthless.

I am pretty sure the big investment banks know these things but they are given investment opportunities in his private businesses in exchange for their silence and their inflated analyst valuations. And they don’t want to shoot themselves in the foot having lent him huge sums of money.

People say Musk won’t let TSLA down because most of his wealth is tied to it. At this point he is milking TSLA for what it is worth. He is borrowing against inflated meme stock prices to buy real companies that are private. He is hedging against the inevitable TSLA crash. His lenders are going with the Ponzi scheme to mitigate the risk to their massive investment. Having borrowed heavily against TSLA shares Musk has no incentive to work for TSLA anymore.

If I have sizable TSLA holdings I would be nervously watching his latest  and totally random OpenAI cash offer of $98 billion or a potential tik tok bid. That means the stock will crater again if he sells stock, he may not care because by now he knows the game is up. Maybe it is triggered by BYD offering free FSD on 20k cars. And this time there might be no coming back. He might offer you first dibs on SpaceX ipo for holding worthless TSLA shares but it sure won’t be cheap.

Disclosure: I don’t have any positions on TSLA at this point.

1iox7z7,5 Years of Investing: My Portfolio & Seeking Advice!,"Hello everyone!

I’ve been investing in Canada for the past five years and exclusively use Wealthsimple as my platform. Honestly, I think it’s the best option for Canadians who don’t have USD accounts.

I was able to pay off my student loan through investing, as I started in my first year of my MBA. After clearing my loan in 2023, I resumed investing, and here’s my current portfolio (listed alphabetically) along with the percentage allocation and gains/losses since purchase:



Portfolio Overview:

	•	AMZN – 6% (+24%)

	•	BAM – 1% (+29%)

	•	BRK.B – 4% (+20%)

	•	CNQ – 3% (-2%)

	•	CP – 2% (-5%)

	•	ENB – 3% (+21%)

	•	FBTC – 2.5% (-9%) Bought a month ago to gain exposure to crypto

	•	FTS – 1% (+15%)

	•	GOOGL – 4% (+25%)

	•	META – 6% (+128%)

	•	MFC – 1% (+65%)

	•	MSFT – 6.5% (+1%)

	•	SHOP – 5% (+74%)

	•	SU – 0.3% (+2%)

	•	TD – 5% (+2%)

	•	TDUP – 0.1% (-87%) Old mistake—been holding for five years, hoping for a turnaround LOL

	•	TECK.A – 0.7% (-12%)

	•	TSLA – 4% (-1%)

	•	VDY – 1% (+0.5%)

	•	VEQT – 4% (+4%)

	•	VTI – 3% (+35%)

	•	WMT – 4% (+54%)

	•	XGRO – 3.5% (+1%)

	•	ZCN – 1% (+10%)



Questions:

	1.	I currently hold 29 stocks, which seems excessive. Are there any that you’d recommend as an immediate SELL?

	2.	Lately, I’ve been increasing my ETF allocation while reducing exposure to volatile stocks. Does this seem like a solid strategy, or should I continue investing in blue-chip tech stocks to maintain strong returns?

	3.	Any other feedback or recommendations?

Note: My portfolio value is around $30,000, and I contribute $1,000–2,000 per month.",2025-02-13 23:49:37,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iox7z7/5_years_of_investing_my_portfolio_seeking_advice/
1inb7p0,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.



What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",2025-02-11 22:20:13,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inb7p0/tsla_isnt_the_nvidia_of_evs_anymore/
1in3m01,Full bearish on TSLA???,"Yeah, you heard me right: Musk's image is now quite disliked by many people—to the point that some are beginning to avoid buying Teslas just to avoid giving him money. I've also heard reports of Teslas being vandalized, with anti-Musk slogans carved into them.

Moreover, last quarter was seen by the market as disappointing, if not delusional, adding a financial component to the concerns. This could be a reason to adopt a bearish outlook on the stock.

What’s your take on it?

1in2fl3,ELI5: what is risk to hold TSLQ for several months?,"Edit:  thanks for replies.  I think I understand better now, the concept of ""decay"" (due to volatility, rebalancing etc) and how an inverse ETF can go down even when the stock it's tracking also goes down.

New question:  let's say I'm willing to make a ""bet"" that TSLA goes down in the next 6-12mo... what is the simplest way for me to make that bet?  Do I really have to get into margin accts and short selling?  Basically I'd like to ""mirror"" TSLA for next 12mo.  Is there a simple way to do that or not really?

\---

I'm new to inverse ETFs and have a small position in TSLQ.  I do know that several 'warnings' say that these style investments are meant for intraday, but since it is an ETF I don't understand the risk of holding for weeks or months.  (apart from the obvious, if the tracking stock goes up)  So here's my question, if the hypothesis comes true (that TSLA goes down over next 6mo) what is the risk to just hold TSLQ ETF for that period?

Another way to ask, is there something else going on with the 'tracking' where over longer periods of time the ETF won't track to certain kinds of losses (eg; during after hours or something else...)?  Is it possible that TSLA goes down over a period of time but somehow TSLQ doesn't gain?

Sorry if this is remedial or breaks any rules please let me know... I'm genuinely confused after reading different things about inverse ETF risks.",2025-02-11 16:21:54,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1in2fl3/eli5_what_is_risk_to_hold_tslq_for_several_months/
1ilg62q,Recap of Magnificent 7 stocks: where do we go from here?,"Basically the Mag 7 is really a Mag 1 to start the year. All stocks disappointed except Meta

Meta up 19% YTD. Strong Q4 results & strong guidance

Alphabet down 7% in the past month. Google Cloud miss & high Capex

Microsoft down 2% for the same reasons. Azure miss & high capex

TSLA down 8% with weak EV deliveries

Apple down 7% YTD. iPhone sales down 1%, China revenue down 11%, revenue growth of just ""low to mid single digits"" for the upcoming quarter 

NVIDIA down 6% YTD. DeepSeek's cost-effective model raises questions

Amazon down 4% after releasing earnings recently. AWS results came in lower than expected & guidance for next quarter's revenue & profit came up short

Curious what others go from here. For some long-term investors, it's a dip for a buying opportunity. Some might stay away given limited upside with DeepSeek, high Capex, and softer revenue growth.

News: [Us Initial Jobless Claims Pick Up But Stay Relatively Low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/us-initial-jobless-claims-pick-up-but-stay-relatively-low)

**Ticker:** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Ford Motor Company reports .39 vs .34 expected, revenue of $48.2 vs 43.6B expected. Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.

**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.

**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).

**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.

**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.

**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)

**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.

**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.

**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.

**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.

**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).

**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).

**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.

**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.

**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).

**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.

**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.

**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a ""mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.""

**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**

**Related Tickers:** QCOM, AVGO, TXN.

1ih835v,Tesla’s Valuation: Speculation or Real Growth? My DCF Insights,"I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here’s what I found. I don’t own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&P. However, with recent events, I’ve been wondering why people hold TSLA.

My typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it’s not perfect, but it’s a way to get started.

For TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.

With these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.

Now, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.

With all that said, it’s hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?

Congrats to all the long-term holders who have made a killing! I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.",2025-02-04 03:09:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ih835v/teslas_valuation_speculation_or_real_growth_my/

1ie0pxa,"Trump to Hit Canada, Mexico With 25% Tariffs on Saturday","* President says he is still weighing 10% tariffs on China
* Canada, Mexico tariffs threaten to upend auto, energy sectors

**Thoughts:** We will literally see a decision from Trump tonight regarding whether or not oil will be exempted from the tariffs, otherwise the stocks I'm watching on the OVERNIGHT exchange are F/GM/TM and TSLA/LCID (stands to lose rather than gain if oil is exempted) in addition to all the oil stocks that are standard (OIL, BP, XOM, etc). We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.

~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~

# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)

>President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”

>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

>“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

>Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

>“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”

>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.

>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

>“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”

>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

>“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”

>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

>He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”
*****
> “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

1ickhww,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

1ib78ft,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",2025-01-27 12:06:13,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ib78ft/the_case_for_tsla_the_business_value/
1i8w8mw,TSLA - will Musk step back as CEO?,"Since he is currently focusing on other activities being involved with the US government, it might be that he will step back as CEO. Maybe his latest actions were on purpose, so that he can be officially removed by the TSLA shareholders. Do you think it might be beneficial for TSLA if he leaves? Do you think it is even possible that he leaves?

I do not hold any TSLA shares atm.

1i8diqm,Reddit ETF progress from Jan 2021 to Jan 2025,"This [Reddit ETF post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ku6skz/reddit_etf/) was made at the beginning of 2021, near the period of peak euphoria.  Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*

 BUT what i am asking is if NVDA/TSLA/LLY/Planatir/etc. have big earnings,miss, can the stock price shake it off and continue an incredible bullish run.. Or is,that generally the end of the extraordinary stock run?

In recnt times, it seems like the 4 stocks i mentioned had really amazing runs (very little precedence i'd say,for,such huge runs over,a medium length period, and eapecially for mega-caps)..  w​as there very little bad news,associated with them? Or,did investors create their bubble-like returns to some degree absent specific good news much of the time (i mean absence,of bi-weekly specific good news)

Something I've wondered for awhile.. Surprisingly i have not seen a research paper on this subject?

Right i am wondering this,about Tesla in particular.. NVDA and LLY have slowed alot.. And Planitir not a key stock

I do know AAPL didn't have a meaningful earnings miss for a long time.. 10 years or so

1i6ij9n,XPEL: Analyzing Growth Potential in the Automotive Market,"Here’s my condensed analysis of XPEL: FYI: I focus on uncovering companies with strong growth potential and sharing my insights.

**Note:** All hyperlinks will lead you to direct source material 

**Disclaimer:** I **DO NOT** own shares of XPEL at the time of writing

I would love to hear from the community and have a in-depth conversation from ya'll. Thank you & enjoy!

# Macro Overview:

**Electric Vehicle Growth**

The U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.

EV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.

**Aging Vehicles**

The average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.

Car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.

**Technological advancements**

[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.

# Investment Thesis:

XPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.

* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home & office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.
* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.

# Risk Factors:

* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.
* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, ""Entrotech, Inc"", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.
* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.

# Conclusion

XPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.

Nonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.",2025-01-21 13:26:39,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i6ij9n/xpel_analyzing_growth_potential_in_the_automotive/

1i0t3rb,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that they are likely to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with Donald Trump’s administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump’s closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump’s re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that’s been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk’s X — the former Twitter — would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X’s efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It’s not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It’s also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk posted in April that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. “In my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,” he wrote on X. “Doing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.”

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn’t respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China’s Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok’s future, also didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok’s fate may no longer be in ByteDance’s sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company’s strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing’s export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok’s valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok’s US operations could be valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That’s a substantial sum even for the world’s richest person. It’s not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his Tesla Inc. business, the person added.

ByteDance’s leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok’s lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution’s First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban — which takes effect Jan. 19 — so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to “save” the app and there’s been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok’s US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be “extraordinarily difficult.”

It’s unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and “Shark Tank” investor Kevin O’Leary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O’Leary has said he discussed with Trump. In the past, Microsoft Corp. had sought to acquire the business, and Oracle Corp. has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app — with different branding — to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It’s not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world’s richest person with businesses that straddle the world’s two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company’s largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration’s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company. 

Very low probability of it happening but interesting to brainstorm trading ideas.

1hte6xi,Arcadium Lithium says shareholders approved Rio Tinto deal,"Shareholders of Arcadium Lithium have given the green light for a $6.7 billion sale to Australian mining heavyweight Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), as announced by the company on Monday.

This news was met with positivity in the stock market, with Arcadium's shares climbing over 2% in after-hours trading.

However, the path to the deal is not without its obstacles. Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders.

These shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation, concealment, and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month.

Earlier in the year, Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share, which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90% premium on Arcadium's closing stock price on October 4, the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters.

The acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium's lithium mines, processing facilities, and deposits located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium's customer base, which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG), and General Motors (NYSE:GM).",2025-01-04 13:17:56,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hte6xi/arcadium_lithium_says_shareholders_approved_rio/
1ht9qr5,Is it worth it to invest time into learning technical analysis? ,"For context, I've been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago, so I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I've just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people's ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65% NVDA and 35% random bullshit, and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal, diagonal, and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above/under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move, seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew.

So I thought, if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock's gonna go, I'd be rich. But if it were that easy, everyone would be rich. And one look through this r/wallstreetbets makes it clear that there's not a lot of people who have achieved that status.

I'm posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there's no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate, but does it help? For example, could you have a better chance at guessing what's gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it? I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time, but would it at least give me a better shot at it?

I haven't tried this at all and so far I've been doing fine, though I know the stuff I've bought have been nice to me in the months I've held it and I can't expect the same in the future (I started with 7k, now at 9k, with 50% of gains unrealized from mostly NVDA and RKLB, 50% of gains realized from TSLA and NVDA calls bought post-election). I know reading these patterns won't help in the long run, as I'm holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future, but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not. Maybe try buying 0dte for SPY and QQQ to harvest some loss porn for WSB.

1jwwtpb,Dollar cost averaging question,"I see a lot of people talking about dollar cost averaging and I think that it’s a really good idea. As the market goes down, you buy more so that your average cost per share decreases.

My question is, does it make sense to dollar cost average out of the stock as well? For example, let’s say that I want to own 20k usd worth of Tesla.  If Tesla continues to rise so that I could sell a share and still have 20k would it make sense to do that and dollar cost average out?  In the same sense that Tesla goes down so I have less than 20k I would then purchase more shares to get my total value of Tesla stock up to $20,000?

This seems like a really simple concept of just having the same value of equity in the company and no one really talks about it, am I missing something?",2025-04-11 18:23:48,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jwwtpb/dollar_cost_averaging_question/
1juwpro,Crude oil an investment with price floor,"With most investments, they have an effective price floor of zero. 
Nvidia, Tesla, GM, BAC any company can go to zero over night but because of the intrinsic self balancing feature of oil price as controlled by OPEC and non-OPEC members. 

Crude oil has a price floor because the producers all have a breakeven price that if it goes under, they all start losing money so they reduce output and bring their price back up. 

For US shale producers in the Permian Basin, that's around $60bbl. For the UAE that's $59bbl. Qatar is $42. 

Right now WTI is at a 52 week low of $62. If it drops another $2 a lot of US producers are gonna start losing money. 

Even with the recession risk that'll drop demand, the suppliers will correspondingly drop supply to keep prices stable. 

As soon as the economy picks back up again, the crude oil price will increase. 

Oil producers can and will go bankrupt but oil will always come back. ",2025-04-09 03:46:10,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1juwpro/crude_oil_an_investment_with_price_floor/
1ju68ef,How China’s Restrictions on Rare Earth Mineral Exports would Affect the EV Industry,"China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, notably tightened as of April 4, 2025, are poised to significantly impact the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) industry. Rare earths like neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for the high-performance magnets in EV motors, while elements like lanthanum are used in batteries. China controls roughly 60-70% of global rare earth mining and nearly 90% of processing, giving it a chokehold on the supply chain that the U.S. EV sector heavily relies on.
The immediate effect is supply disruption. The U.S. imports about 74% of its rare earths from China (down from 80% a decade ago), and with export controls escalating—starting with gallium, germanium, and graphite in 2023 and expanding to other rare earths in 2024 and 2025—manufacturers like Tesla, General Motors, and Ford could face shortages. A single EV motor can require 1-2 kilograms of rare earth magnets, and with U.S. EV sales projected to hit 1.5-2 million units annually by 2030, the demand for these materials is massive. Without a steady supply, production lines could slow or halt, delaying deliveries and driving up costs.
Cost increases are already in motion. Post-restriction price spikes have historical precedent: in 2011, when China cut exports, rare earth prices soared—neodymium hit $67,000 per metric ton. Recent data shows neodymium at $75,097 per metric ton and dysprosium up 4.65% to $250.60 per kilogram as of late 2024, with analysts expecting further climbs in 2025 due to these bans. EVs already use six times more minerals than conventional cars, and with graphite (another restricted mineral) being the largest component in battery anodes (up to 136 pounds per EV), battery prices could jump 18% or more, pushing sticker prices higher and potentially slowing consumer adoption.
Geopolitical leverage amplifies the strain. China’s moves are a response to U.S. tariffs and tech curbs, like the Biden administration’s December 2024 semiconductor export limits. With 90% of heavy rare earths (like dysprosium, critical for EV motor heat resistance) processed in China, a full ban could cripple production timelines. The U.S. has only one active rare earth mine—Mountain Pass in California—producing 15% of global supply, but it lacks sufficient domestic processing capacity. MP Materials, the operator, ships much of its output to China for refining, and its Fort Worth magnet facility won’t be fully online until late 2025 at earliest.
Mitigation efforts are underway but slow. The U.S. is investing in domestic supply chains—Biden’s 2021 Executive Order 14017 and the Inflation Reduction Act pump millions into mining and recycling—but scaling up takes years. Alternatives like Australia (10% of global supply) or Vietnam exist, but their output is dwarfed by China’s, and processing still often routes through Chinese facilities. Recycling could offset 30% of future rare earth demand, yet only 1% is currently recycled in the U.S. Tesla’s shift away from rare earths in next-gen motors is promising, but it’s not yet scalable across the industry.
The EV industry faces a triple hit: delayed production, higher costs, and strategic vulnerability. A total graphite ban alone could slash EV output, given China’s 77% share of natural graphite and 95% of synthetic graphite production. Add rare earth curbs, and the U.S. could lose ground in the global EV race, with economic losses estimated at $3.4 billion in GDP from just gallium and germanium restrictions. Without rapid diversification or innovation, China’s restrictions could stall America’s electric dreams.

1jtpf5k,Will the sentiment around Trump & his tariffs affect Tesla’s stock specifically?,"\[Update\]: This got kicked by the Automods and I had a hard time getting it allowed. It’s a little stale now, especially with things changing so fast, but I would still like to have the conversation.

I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, let me jump right to the question for you:

Will the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

\---------------------------------------

For those looking for something to read, here you go:

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain.

Here is a great interview with the well-respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those who do not want to watch the whole video, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".

1. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends.

1. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*

1. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.

1. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession.

1. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us).

1. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices.

1. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.

1. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).

1. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business have very long time-cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.

1. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.

1. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. This will cause more market volatility.

1. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view.

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administration’s haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out as being far more likely to be of great benefit to China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR) (\*a lot has changed in the three days since I made this chart/post).

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from its recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen any *real* damage to its share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon!

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised his voters that he would do.

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the rosiest picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself).

If there is real and lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers (Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future) boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow.

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost (and counting). While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time.

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla.

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

Current P/E of 100+ is ridiculous and I personally think it should be worth less then 25$ a share. However, I have been following this stock and honestly: I never had the balls to short it. Seeing how irrational this stock behaved, and how many times short sellers got screwed. Never have I been more convinced a stock is incredibly overvalued though. but I admit I was too chicken.

I think the bubble has bursted and it wil keep dropping from where we are.  
Tesla is the main reason why I am not ""buying the dip"" with ETF's. It's my example/gauge of how the US stock market is still heavily overvalued right now.

1jrqzht,Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era,"Elon Musk’s ventures have long dominated “space investing” conversations – but with Musk’s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn’t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10–11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn’t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let’s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab’s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They’ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab’s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer – Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn’t waiting around: they’ve signed new launch deals (e.g. an 8-launch contract with Japan’s iQPS just announced) , and they delivered on missions like launching 8 satellites for OroraTech with just 4 months’ turnaround , showcasing operational excellence.
* Government and Commercial Tailwinds: Unlike many space SPACs and startups that struggled, Rocket Lab has real customers and repeat business. Their backlog is \~$1.1B , split \~50/50 between government and commercial clients – providing diversification. Notably, Rocket Lab was selected for the U.S. Space Force’s NSSL Phase 3 (Lane 1) program , making them eligible for missions under a $5.6B launch contract umbrella alongside incumbents like SpaceX and ULA. They also hold a $515M contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to build missile-tracking satellite systems . These wins not only validate Rocket Lab’s technology in the eyes of key customers, but also ensure a baseline of revenue in coming years. In essence, Rocket Lab is aligning itself as a core player in future government space infrastructure – a recurring revenue stream that many “new space” companies lack.
* Musk Factor – or Lack Thereof: From an investing standpoint, one could argue that Musk has become a risk factor. Tesla’s own 10-K warned that the brand is tied to Musk’s reputation , and indeed we’ve seen political backlash contribute to Tesla’s sales slump and stock drop . SpaceX, while successful, is privately funded and also influenced by Musk’s persona (which might carry regulatory or public image risks, given his role in government and polarizing public statements). Rocket Lab provides a “Musk-free” exposure to the space sector. CEO Peter Beck is an engineer-executive who keeps a lower profile. There’s no cult of personality driving Rocket Lab’s valuation – which means less idiosyncratic risk. In fact, Rocket Lab’s shares are more directly correlated with its execution (launch success, contracts, revenue) than with any social media narrative. For an investor, that can be reassuring.

Valuation Considerations: After the recent pullback, RKLB trades at a more reasonable multiple relative to its growth. It had skyrocketed over 400% in the past year , but is now off highs. Analysts still see upside: Cantor Fitzgerald recently reaffirmed an Overweight with a $24 target , and other targets range up to $33 . Clearly, expectations are that Rocket Lab will continue to scale and eventually approach profitability as Neutron comes into service. Risks include execution delays (a short-seller argued Neutron could be late to 2026 , which would slow revenue growth) and competition (SpaceX’s dominance, emerging players like Blue Origin). However, Rocket Lab’s head start in small launch and established customer base give it a moat in its niche. Its enterprise value ($11B) is a fraction of SpaceX’s ($140B private valuation), so investors are essentially betting that Rocket Lab can capture even a small slice of SpaceX’s market share in the coming years – which would justify significant upside.

Conclusion: If you’re disillusioned with Musk or simply want a piece of the space sector’s growth, Rocket Lab is one of the most compelling options available. It combines the innovation of New Space with the accountability of a public company. As always, invest based on your due diligence (space is a risky industry), but RKLB offers a balanced risk-reward profile: solid current business, big future bets, and freedom from the Elon factor. For many, that’s an attractive proposition in 2025 and beyond.

1jrj6vf,Tariffs & Tesla- Will the hit affect sentiment around Tesla? And are you a goldfish?,"I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, just move on. 

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain. 

Here is a great interview with the well respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those with short attention spans, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".
2. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends. 
3. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*  
4. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.
5. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession. 
6. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us). 
7. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices. 
8. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.
9. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).
10. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business has very long time cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.
11. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.
12. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. 
13. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view. 

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administrations haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

\*I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out, as far more likely to be of great benefit China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR)

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from it's recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen an *real* damage to it's share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon! 

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. He is going to build a car in 5-seconds. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. Fact: It is physically impossible to build an entire car in 5-seconds because of physics (Newton's Second Law applies here: F=ma). It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised voters that he would do. He will have to pick between his voters and Elon soon enough. 

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.   

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the most rosy picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself). But if there is real lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers, Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future, boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.  

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow. 

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost- and counting. While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a bandaid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time. 

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla. 

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University—Rosedale seat.

“As soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,” she said in a statement texted to the Star.

“I also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.”""

1jixx9v,Opening an individual brokerage account,"So I already have a 401k that is broadly diversified. It’s in US index funds, international stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. It’s gotten a lifetime rate of return just above 8.5% since its inception. I get a 100% match up to six percent and I put in a little more than that (7%). I started it when I was in my early 20s and now that I’m mid thirties it has a healthy balance albeit I’m not maxing out contributions, only slightly more than enough to get my full match.

I also take advantage of my company stock purchase plan and get a 15% match up to a certain dollar amount. I just started doing this within the past year. 

I do have an emergency fund. It could be larger but has two months of expenses saved up. 

I thought about opening up an individual brokerage account (like Robinhood or Fidelity) to start a third investment. For two reasons:

1. It allow me to access the money sooner than 59 and a half if I were to ever need/want to. So travel, home repairs, supplement possible early retirement etc. However it wouldn’t be unless I really needed to access it. 

2. I could pick stocks/index funds I really want to invest in, or avoid those I don’t want. My 401k does invest minorly in oil companies and Tesla. I prefer to avoid these if at all possible and could either pick several companies I like (Microsoft, Apple, Google, NVDA, etc.) and invest in them. Hoping tech might outperform my more diversified 401k. 

It seems my 401k already invests in broad index funds like BlackRock Russell 1000 index fund. So investing in the S&P 500 seems like it would be redundant, no?

It wouldn’t be a lot of money a month. I’d continue to add to my HYSA emergency fund more, but throw some spare money (say $50-$100 a month) at a brokerage account just to see what happens? Or am I better off just putting the money in my 401k due to the tax advantage? Currently the bulk of my 401k is in a pretax account but I have a small (and growing) portion in a Roth 401k.

1jgkamz,TSLA Fair Value Analysis: The bull The Bear . The case for the 140 and 180 Valuation,"

TL;DR: Tesla is significantly overvalued at current levels ($240). Fair value range $140-180 based on deteriorating growth metrics, declining margins, and elevated valuation multiples. Current prices require near-perfect execution on unproven future tech bets.

---

I've been watching the Tesla story unfold for years, and recent developments demand a sober reassessment of the stock's fair value. After diving into the latest financials and operational metrics, I believe the market is significantly overestimating Tesla's near-term prospects.

Current Market Sentiment vs. Financial Reality

While Wall Street maintains an average price target around $310-340, I see a serious disconnect with Tesla's financial performance:

Stagnant Growth: 2024 revenue grew a meager 0.95% YoY, with the company posting its first-ever annual delivery decline
Margin Compression: Q4 operating margin fell to 6.2%, down from 8.2% a year earlier, as Tesla sacrifices profitability for volume
Valuation Stretch: Currently trading at 161x P/E - astronomical even for a growth company, especially one showing signs of maturation

The Cybertruck Debacle: Canary in the Coal Mine

The Cybertruck situation isn't just about recalls or insurance challenges - it exposes fundamental issues with Tesla's execution:

* Production challenges with new materials and manufacturing techniques
* Price points that severely limit market potential (originally pitched as a mass-market vehicle)
* Sales volumes falling dramatically short of projections (40K annually vs. Musk's 250K target)

Why $140-180 is Fair Value

A 40-50% downside from current levels might seem extreme, but consider:

1. Rational Multiples: A 50-75x P/E would still be generous for a company with stalled growth and margin pressure. This alone justifies significant contraction.

2. Auto Industry Fundamentals: Legacy automakers typically trade at 5-15x earnings. Even with Tesla's energy business and software potential, a 100% premium to industry leaders feels more appropriate than the current 1000%+ premium.

3. Valuation Models Agree: Discounted cash flow analyses consistently show fair value around $150, with some sophisticated models suggesting even lower targets.

* Sell covered calls to generate income while holding core positions
* Focus on defined-risk options strategies rather than outright stock ownership

For bears (No not the NCR ):
* Consider put spreads 6+ months out to avoid short-term volatility
* Focus on strike prices in the $180-200 range for optimal risk/reward

For neutral investors(Finally I escape the FNV brain rot ) :
* Wait for better entry points in the $140-180 range
* Use cash-secured puts at those levels to potentially acquire shares at even better prices

Risk Factors To My Thesis

I acknowledge several potential upside catalysts:

* The affordable model (expected H1 2025) could exceed volume expectations
* FSD/robotaxi progress could accelerate more quickly than anticipated
* Trump administration policies could benefit Tesla's competitiveness
* Energy storage business could see inflection point in growth/margins

## Bottom Line

The market is pricing Tesla as if every ambitious future project will succeed perfectly. History shows that even the most visionary companies encounter delays, setbacks, and execution challenges. A fair valuation needs to account for these risks.

At $140-180, Tesla would still command a premium valuation that respects its innovation potential while acknowledging the very real headwinds it faces in 2025-2026.

1jdd2hh,Anatomy of gas lighting investors,"Trump Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is worth about 500 million dollars.  During his tenure at Soros Fund Management he brought in over a billion dollars betting on the collapse of the British pound  (Black Wednesday), he also made out like a bandit betting on the collapse of the Yen.

He started his own investment firm, Key Square Group.  which did so badly they lost a ton of investors until the economic boom under Biden. His firm was very profitable 2021-2023.  The S&P under Biden gave us + 58% or so return or so (corrected).

He recently said what the Trump stock market tank is just an ordinary cycle, and that had we not prospered so much in 2006, 2007 we would not have had the ""market correction"" of 2008.  2008 was caused by deregulation and bad loans (amongst other things).   He is gaslighting investors and all Americans

He stands to make a ton of money from an impending recession.

Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, is an investment banker and worth between 2-4 billion dollars. He is on record saying Trump tariffs are ""worth it"" if they cause a recession. He has also said it's Biden's fault if we have a recession.

Biden oversaw the best economy we have seen in 50 years.

What these men have in common is both are bullshitting investors and all Americans.  Egg prices could go to $500 a dozen and they would buy the same amount of eggs they do now and not feel a thing.  They will also profit during a recession and they will be in  a great position to buy anything they want at cheap prices.

No telling how many White House insiders are shorting the S&P and other funds.

It's important that investors scrutinize the economy as well as those who are implementing policies that are degrading the market and realize when you are being gaslighted by those will profit from investor ignorance.

Finally, you hear a lot of noise these days with mindless cliches: ""timing the market"" or ""panic selling"" from people who are so gas lit you should avoid smoking around them to avoid combustion.

Buffet is sitting on more cash in the history of BRK and for a reason, and he has clearly said tariffs are not paid by the tooth fairy (they are paid by you and I).

The best thing an investor can do right now is understand fundamental economics and recognize when you are being gaslighted.  What you are seeing is not a market correction nor an ordinary cycle.  You're witnessing a very healthy market get tanked, and on purpose.

The irony is the market tries to love Trump.  They love his deregulation, low taxes for the rich and corporations, the end of red tape, etc.  The market loved his election win and we were seeing fresh highs.

Until he started his trade wars and threats to invade, and annex foreign countries.

Finally, both Trump and Elon have said it's going to be ""painful"" for a ""while"".  It will not be painful for them.  They will feel nothing, Trump has made hundreds of millions in the last few months off of his various grifts, Elon has tanked Tesla with his Nazi antics, but it's not like he's having to go to fewer movies or tighten his budget.

In March of 2021 they came out with “*The 630× Decade: 10 Stocks for the Next Tech Revolution”.* In short, the report recommended stocks that they reasoned were uniquely positioned to take advantage of the self-driving car revolution. It was timed to coincide with a then-upcoming announcement from Tesla, in which they believed Tesla would finally unveil their full self-driving update. The potential gains, they said, reached as high as 630 times over the next decade. Of course, there was the requisite warning that there were no guarantees, and that probably not every stock would be a winner. Now, four years later, we’re not exactly at the midway point, but my personal opinion is that anywhere between four and six years is fair for a midterm review. So, here are the stocks, starting with the winners and moving downward to the losers. TLDNR version - any investor who bought and held is looking at a return of **83 cents on the dollar** today.

1jc0xk4,The situation of the market,"
Many stocks in the market are significantly overvalued—Tesla, Apple, Costco, Palantir, and much of the FMCG and pharmaceutical sectors, considering their sluggish growth. Even Nvidia could see its valuation tumble if China or AMD develop viable alternatives.

Market crashes don’t worry me; they’re necessary and often present great buying opportunities. What truly concerns me is the long-term effect of excess liquidity. Inflation is brewing beneath the surface, and we’ll see its full impact in the years ahead. Over time, the velocity of money has declined while the money supply has surged, artificially propping up asset prices. My real fear isn’t a crash—it’s that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.

Bonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn’t a market for investors—it’s a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.

If inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins. After years of zero interest rates and relentless quantitative easing, my biggest concern is that when the real downturn hits, the Fed will have little ammunition left to respond.",2025-03-15 17:55:52,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc0xk4/the_situation_of_the_market/
1j9ygro,Remembering stock market crash of 2022,"It’s easy to forget how short the market’s memory is.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren’t making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn’t just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google’s ad revenue shrank. Microsoft’s growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they’ll never go up again. When they’re at all-time highs, it feels like they’ll never go down. Neither is true.

So investors, it's going to be fine. Just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.",2025-03-12 23:46:22,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9ygro/remembering_stock_market_crash_of_2022/
1j9rkno,CHGG: 20% downside / 200%+ upside?,"I ran a financial analysis on Chegg (CHGG) and... I am excited! 

Fight me if you disagree with the thesis below.

In a nutshell:

\-the **market cap ($80m) is currently largely below the net asset position value ($213m),** while the company is cash flow positive with more than **$400m+ of revenues**

\-a cost cutting plan is currently being implemented and there is a lot to cut: **the company spent $170m on R&D in 2024...**

\-the management has initiated a strategic review: ""*we are undertaking a strategic review process and exploring a range of alternatives to maximize shareholder value,* ***including being acquired, undertaking a go-private transaction***"" (this quote is from Q4 24).

\-Market cap is so low compared to the net asset value, the stock could easily do 2-3x when the outcome is announced; **Goldman Sachs has been hired**.

\-In addition, a lawsuit has been filed against Google who is previewing Chegg's content in AI-powered search (IP infringement): Chegg could get **up to c. $500m in compensatory damages** due to revenue loss caused by AI Overviews (estimated at c. $100-200m annual hit)

\-Yes, the topline is currently declining 20%: this is a similar growth profile to what is coming for Tesla... **except that we are on less than 2x P/E and less than 1x EBITDA**, while having a positive **net asset position at 3x the market cap!**

\-Finally, **the stock is highly shorted**

**This is not a financial advice, just my own analysis. I really like the stock.**

\*\*\*

**Few numbers below as of 31-Dec-24:**

\-Market cap of $80m (current market cap as of today)

\-Cash: $161m

\-Short-term investments (government bonds): $154m

\-Long-term investments (government bonds): $213m

**=> total cash + government bond position: $528m**

\-Liabilities: a convertible bond: $359 + $127 = $486m

**=> Net cash position = $42m**

\-Properties: $171m

**=> Net cash position + value of properties = $213m (2.7x the market cap!!)**",2025-03-12 18:49:30,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9rkno/chgg_20_downside_200_upside/

Tesla isn’t fundamentally broken, this is just market sentiment and negative media. It has billions in cash, can pivot into AI, energy, and robotics and long-term EV adoption is inevitable.

Investing only what I can afford to lose, so if it went to $0 (it won’t), I’d be fine. Any unrealised loss is just on paper, I’m holding long-term and recovery is inevitable.

1j6jbvv,"Are stock valuations simply a product of investor belief in scarcity? If we treat stocks as a store of value, like Bitcoin, gold, or even Tesla, does that make traditional macroeconomic analysis less relevant?","I have been thinking about how we value stocks and why traditional macroeconomic analysis still holds water in today’s markets. Typically, stocks are evaluated using earnings, growth rates, interest rates, and other economic indicators. Yet, oftentimes prices seem driven more by narrative and investor sentiment than by fundamentals.

Tesla offers an example. At times, its stock price has soared far beyond what traditional metrics might justify. Much of its valuation appears linked to the story of its potential to revolutionize energy and transportation. Many see Tesla not simply as an auto manufacturer but as an innovation pioneer. Its market value then reflects the belief that investing in Tesla secures a piece of a scarce, transformative opportunity.

Consider Bitcoin. Its appeal stems largely from its fixed supply. Investors treat it as digital gold, a scarce asset that preserves value even though it does not generate revenue. Similarly, gold is prized not for income but for its long history as a reliable store of value, especially in uncertain times.

This leads me to ask: if investors increasingly view stocks as stores of value like Bitcoin or gold, does that lessen the importance of macroeconomic fundamentals? 

Are we increasingly buying into a narrative based on scarcity rather than relying on hard economic data? 

Is there a shift in perspective underway and would it be sustainable or will traditional fundamental analysis remain crucial for evaluating investments.",2025-03-08 15:19:56,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j6jbvv/are_stock_valuations_simply_a_product_of_investor/

1j1rt79,Which companies/funds will be hit hard in next major market downturn?,"So in every major market downturn a lot of companies are brought down even those that may not be expected. 

For example in the Dot com bubble in addition to tech stocks you had the collapse of Enron and MCI Worldcom. 

In 2008 in addition to bank stocks you had insurance such as AIG, big three automakers, General Electric etc.

2020 you had a lot of retailers that had been struggling for years file for bankruptcy.

Here are my predictions of who/what will be impacted:

*  Crypto - Too many meme coins and speculation. There will be a massive correction due soon not sure if as severe as 2022 but its coming
* Office Space REITS- some of these have recovered but I don't see their finances improving anytime soon as return to office has been very gradual. Also recent federal cuts will hurt demand especially in suburban office space markets.
* Meme Stocks in particular Tesla and Game stop. Telsa's PE ratio is way too high and Musk's recent antics have hurt future sales prospects. Gamestop also has way too high of a PE ratio. In a downturn people will turn away and its price will collapse
* Broadcast /Cable companies - These companies are struggling with cord cutting. In a downturn this will be first thing many consumers cut. Comcast is very vulnerable. Also any regional sports stocks such as MSGE will get hit. 
* Almost every remaining regional retailer that is publicly traded. I'm not sure how many of these are honestly left but any non national retailer that does not have a decent web presence will have a decent chance of not surviving next downturn. 
* AI related stocks. Companies have been spending hundreds of billions for their AI buildout. There will be cuts to AI budgets that not only impact NVDA and AI oriented stocks, but any REITs that own data centers, power companies doing build outs 
* Oil and Gas companies. US production has increase significantly even after blip during pandemic. Due to higher drilling costs in the US expect any dip in oil price to wipe out a lot of producers especially if they are too leveraged in debt.

1izkzc2,"Curious about TSLA and co-mingling with SpaceX, Twitter, and Starlink","Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?  I mean, when most companies spin off another entity, there's usually some sort of compensation, right?

What is trailing p/e vs forward p/e?

p/e represents the multiple that investors pay for each $ of company earnings

Trailing uses last years REAL earnings, for NVDA this is at ~50 (currently about +10 or more higher than all other stocks besides Tesla- which btw is still just a car company- check their income statement. 

Forward uses PROJECTED EARNINGS - this is your 30 p/e and if you’re no skeptical about this after the deep seek news

EUPHORIA

Edit: because some users seem to think I would never at any time buy a growth stocks based on this theory…

I 100% would buy growth stocks- in fact, I own some NVDA through ETFs and have owned even more up until very recently. My argument is that much of the calculation of forward p/e that makes NVDA seem relatively “cheap” at 30 is made up on high expectations that were pricing in immense amounts of demand that even without the deep seek news needed to be near perfect yet now we have all this macro news on top of that to make the risk higher.

I can go further by saying the market is as levered as it’s ever been with margin accounts accruing debits nearly surpassing the post-Covid inflation money printing bubble.

1ixvmn7,The Bull Case for Xpeng ($XPEV),"**Why Xpeng stock ($XPEV) can 5x to hit US$100 (and beyond?) by end-2026**

Below is a condensed report, drop me a PM if you want to know more. Also, if China stocks are not your thing, either risk-, political-, personal-, or other-wise, kindly ignore. I was not paid or sponsored to write this and do not have glowing EV or AI credentials, but I have been diligently researching and studying the EV industry (including Xpeng) since 2020.

**INTRODUCTION**

Xpeng is a Chinese EV maker headed by CEO He Xiaopeng, with dual listings in the USA and Hong Kong. Its current price as of today is around US$19.5 with a market capitalization of around US$18.6 billion.

But is it really just an automaker? I’d argue Xpeng is in fact a software company providing full-stack AI mobility solutions, and seems hugely underestimated by analysts and markets alike. Here’s why Xpeng could see large growth in the coming years, perhaps hitting US$100 by end-2026 (or \~US$100 billion market cap), using a simple SWOT analysis.

**STRENGTHS** 

1. **Product & Design:** Xpeng’s cars have always had aesthetics in mind, with their latest P7+ and sub-brand MONA M03 sedans’ stylish looks, best-in-class comfort, and large space now huge bestsellers in China. Xpeng is now the 3rd best selling EV carmaker in China at the moment, behind BYD, Wuling, and Geely.
2. **Affordability:** Xpeng cars are kept affordable while retaining many luxury and tech features, providing good value-for-money.
3. **Cutting-edge Technology & Features:** Outstanding Xpeng tech includes an in-house powertrain integrated with the vehicle chassis, plus outstanding autonomous driving capabilities and smart features.
4. **Strong Leadership Team:** In 2023, CEO Xiaopeng and President Wang Fengying overhauled the management team, rooted out corruption, eradicated departmental inefficiencies, and shifted to a more user-centric focus. The CEO remains humble and fully committed to building the company to reach greater heights.
5. **Strong Supply Chain, Marketing & Branding Management:** After a tumultuous 2022 and 2023, Xpeng’s product, marketing, and supply chain teams are now all working harmoniously to swiftly ramp up production and deliver blockbuster hits one after another.
6. **Financials:** The [CEO has recently hinted at a breakeven quarter this year](https://cnevpost.com/2025/02/07/xpeng-expects-break-even-single-quarter-2025/), which will be a pivotal turning point for the company and change in valuation metrics.

**WEAKNESSES**

1. **Low Brand Strength & Perception:** Xpeng is slowly but surely growing its reputation in China and overseas, with stronger sales.
2. **Intense Industry Competition & Price Wars Creating Margin Erosion:** Might not necessarily be a weakness since competition breeds innovation and efficiency (see Deepseek). Moreover, Xpeng has several cost advantages, such as Gigapresses and joint raw materials purchases with partner Volkswagen.

**OPPORTUNITIES** 

1. **Strong 2025 Pipeline:** 2025 official target deliveries is 380–400,000. However looking at their strong pipeline, especially for L3 autonomous driving, I am forecasting 450–500,000 deliveries for this year, with a possibility of attaining 800,000+ EV deliveries for 2026.
2. **Autonomous Driving (AD) & Self Driving Cars:** Xpeng is a strong contender for this race, with the CEO declaring in January 2025 they will achieve Quasi-L3 AD by mid-2025 and Full L3 AD by end of 2025.
3. **Flying Cars:** Xpeng’s Land Aircraft Carrier (modular van and flying eVTOL module) will start deliveries in 2026 (no, this is not a wild going-by-faith projection, the [factory is currently under construction with target completion in 3Q 2025](https://cnevpost.com/2024/10/27/xpeng-aeroht-flying-car-base-breaks-ground/)). Their entry will shake up the low-altitude economy due to its mass production capabilities, cost advantages, and synergies with EV production and technology. But don't expect this business to have a huge impact on the stock by itself.
4. **Humanoid Robots:** Xpeng’s bipedal, all-purpose Iron Robots have already been deployed in Xpeng’s factories and stores, and are expected to enter trial commercial use in the second half of 2025, meaning commercial use may come in 2026, including **talking and moving like humans.** Much potential in this enormous space for Xpeng, which has several differences in its robot tech from its peers (with the CEO just saying he is confident [Xpeng will deploy one of the earliest mass-produced L3 robots in China](https://m.weibo.cn/status/5137890441693096)).
5. **AI Car Chips:** Xpeng will mass-produce their potentially game-changing Turing AI chip in mid-2025 (3x the computing power of industry standard Nvidia's Drive Orin-X), where it will set off a chain motion of new product launches. Possible to be adopted by other automakers too. Angus McKenzie from Motortrend has speculated that if Xpeng’s Turing Chip lives up to its full potential, it could be a [Deepseek moment for the car industry](https://www.motortrend.com/news/xpeng-develops-ai-chip-deepseek-moment/). 
6. **Robocars & Robotaxis:** The final step in autonomous driving (L4/L5 AD), and with endless possibilities: From transportation to food delivery to mobile convenience stores to F&B to ecommerce deliveries. Coupled with Iron Robot can achieve wonders in any industry.
7. **Global Expansion:** Xpeng car sales are accelerating around the world, with a targeted presence in 60 countries by end of 2025, compared to 30 as of end 2024.
8. **Increasing Partnerships & Institutional Investors:** Existing partnerships and investments by Volkswagen may deepen, and institutional investors (domestic or foreign) may start to invest in Xpeng as it becomes recognized worldwide.

**THREATS** 

1. **Competition:** There is always intense **price competition** in the EV sector, whether in China or overseas. However, Xpeng is in a sweet spot of value for money and product, and will continue to attract customers in the entry-level range. **Competition in autonomous driving** is fierce, and there’s a chance another car company unlocks L3 and L4 before Xpeng. However, Xpeng will get there eventually too, and it has other prospects, plus it can always catch up and outshine with its robocar offerings. Some may also be worried that **copycats** will mimic Xpeng’s popular car models bolt for bolt, but it’s not so simple as Xpeng has built up a decade’s worth of proprietary innovation and expertise in building cutting-edge EVs. And will continue to do so.
2. **Loss of Innovation:** Xpeng depends heavily on its tech innovation to stand out. Loss of key men may cause a brain drain and loss of technological edge. Xpeng is tackling this by recruiting the best and brightest, and heavily invested in R&D.
3. **Geopolitical Tensions:** I believe a **major war is very unlikely** under the current Trump administration. But increasing friction between USA and China may spark another call for **delisting of China ADRs**, which if comes to pass will create volatility in the stock prices, but I feel Xpeng’s stock will eventually recover and push higher as the company performs well (will have small forex risk though). USA may also decide to **tighten EV chip restrictions** on China automakers, but that will not affect Xpeng as it transitions to its own Turing Chip for all its products in mid-2025 (may turn out to be a boon instead as competitors falter).
4. **Global or Domestic Economic Softness:** Any economic slowdown in China or the rest of the world will have a mixed effect on Xpeng’s position as an affordable, mass market, smart EV brand. A slowdown could actually spur more consumers to go for bang-for-their-buck cars, and Xpeng fits the bill perfectly.

**SUMMARY**

Do you want to own a company that can potentially change the world? Xpeng could turn out to be the **Tesla of China, Figure AI of China, Archer Aviation of China, Nvidia of Cars: All rolled into one!**

The risk reward looks tremendously positive. And the worst case I can see right now is the stock goes sideways due to inexplicable stagnation in its domestic and overseas EV car business, PLUS all its other exciting prospects — Autonomous Driving, Flying Cars, AI Chips, Robots, Robocars — fall flat.

BUT, in a good scenario (not necessarily the best case even), if one or two of Xpeng’s businesses blast off? A review of each and my estimated valuations (now and end-2026, with estimated annual sales):

1. **EV Cars (Semi-AD)** — Current (**L2 AD**, 300K annual sales): US$18 Billion | End 2026 (**L3 AD**, 800K-1M sales + huge/growing orderbook): US$50–60 Billion *(Benchmarked against BYD & Li Auto valuation)*
2. **Flying Cars** — Current (3K orderbook): US$1 Billion | End 2026 (10K sales + 10–30K orderbook, depends on type): US$5–20 Billion *(*[*Benchmarked against Archer Aviation valuation*](https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2024/Archer-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Demonstrating-Manufacturing-Certification-and-Commercial-Launch-Momentum/default.aspx)*)*
3. **Robots** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (5–10K sales + 10–100K orderbook): US$5–60 Billion *(Wildcard, Enormous potential,* [*Benchmarked against Figure AI valuation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/robotics-startup-figure-ai-in-talks-for-new-funding-at-39-5-billion-valuation)*)*
4. **AI Chips** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (0–20K orderbook + partnerships): US$2–20 Billion *(Big wildcard at the moment)*
5. **Robocars (Full-AD)** — Current: Nil | End 2026 (10–50K orderbook + partnerships): US$5–40 Billion *(Enormous potential,* [*Benchmarked against Waymo & Tesla valuation*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-waymo-stock-tesla-robotaxis-29a57e01) *with big haircut)*

Is this so ridiculous? Bear in mind Tesla’s sky high valuation for its future autonomous driving, robot, and robocar plays. Now Xpeng is valued at a mere 1.8% of Tesla. A major product breakthrough can trigger a sharp bull run for Xpeng, cause short-sellers to stay away, and maybe turn it into a meme stock. Just my 2 cents.

1inu9y7,Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?,"I’m not a Tesla expert, and I’m sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla’s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I’m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.

Here’s a list of what bothers me:

1. **Elon Musk’s PR Nightmare** – It’s hard to ignore how much Musk’s public image has deteriorated. Between the “Sieg Heil” incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he’s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla’s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** – Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that’s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** – Tesla’s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that’s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** – The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s next big thing, but it’s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it’s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** – Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla’s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** – Tesla’s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there’s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** – Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** – Tesla’s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** – Tesla’s alignment with Musk’s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla’s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they’re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I’ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

1ik5337,Chinese Markets are Rejecting Tesla,"China Is Moving On from Tesla  
  
Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations",2025-02-07 20:39:55,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ik5337/chinese_markets_are_rejecting_tesla/
1ijwa8v,Hedge strategy for a tech heavy portfolio ?,"Hey,

I'm long term bullish on tesla, some things musk did lately bothered me but overall I still believe in the long term self driving and humanoid robots, even if it happens years later than expected.

And I hold bitcoin, bullish on it.


So overall this portfolio has potential long term, but lacks any sort of hedging and diversification I totally feel that.

At the point I'm at, I can see myself having my portfolio slashed 50% in 1 month, i can see that happen, so I wanna put the new money elsewhere, but also keep my current positions that I'm bullish on, as they are.


I don't really wanna get into sp500 as it is, as it's so tech boosted, and I'm already so exposed to tech.

I soon expect to get alot of new returns tha I plan to invest somewhere else, to keep the growth/ speculative part as I have and not touch it.

And create the other part that aims to give like stable returns, and hold pretty well in a black swan or bear market type event.
So I want to avoid speculative future projection tech sort of stuff, that also includes the sp500.
I don't want FAANG stocks, apple nvidia google etc, some are more hyped than others and some are probably not so bad I know tesla is a nig one, but still I wanna keep out of it as I'm already in it.

And perhaps I also don't want to be too correlated with united states alone.

Any sort of perhaps actively managed etf, that perhaps has some cash, some long positions on boring stuff

And some shorts on bad/scam/useless companies ? And maybe 25% of portfolio being shorts ?

With long term annual returns of maybe like 7-8% a year. And a better resilience in a bear market situation, due to low speculation(tech) exposure, and some shorts that would in that case be in green.

So overall maybe slight underperformance of sp500, but better resilience and less volatility. With still decent 8% a year gains, is that reasonable to ask for ?

It's important that it has atleast like 6-7 years of track record

Anyone knows a good etf for that ? Or some form of investment that can do something like this ?

1ii7cew,There is either too much money in the system or people are learining how ti invest,"I am absolutely passionate about investing and I have been for years, with results way above my expectations. I am noticing however that most companies are being priced correctly.

I am not talking about hyper exuberant companies (Tesla, Palantir...) but most blue chip stocks.   
Microsoft, Google, Visa, Mastercard (1.5-3% FCFY plus strong growth) .. but also less growth oriented companies like Pepsi, Kroger... (4-5% FCFY and a bit of growth)... Railways are more stable, so they trade between 3-5% FCY, are all trading around fair value IMO.

Actually I think the equity risk premium is a bit down and right know stocks are fairly priced with respect to treasuries (4-5% FCY, no growth). IMO there are still some attractive opportunities (bought uber last month), but the market is behaving quite well. 

Maybe this is the results of too much money in the system, desperately competing for limited assets, but I also think that people learning about the stock market (and flooding to ETFs) are making it more efficient, not less. 

I am not complaining, I think its ok that people are no longer over ridicolously cheap opportunities. Investing shouldn't be easy, so seeing fair prices is kind of good. Its not the mother of all bubbles, its actually fair that you don't make 15% per year while doing nothing. 

In short, congratulation to everybody that is consistently staying invested in the market, you are doing great and I am happy for you.

1ihklb7,Tesla over valued should it be shorted?,"
Over the past few years, Tesla’s stock has been propelled by a narrative of future technological breakthroughs and visionary leadership. However, a closer look at the underlying fundamentals—and in particular a comparison with Chinese giant BYD—reveals several concerning points:
	
1.	Superior Sales and Market Penetration of BYD
	•	In 2022, BYD sold approximately 1.86 million new energy vehicles worldwide, compared with Tesla’s 1.31 million deliveries globally (with only about 440,000 delivered in China) [ ￼].
	
•	BYD’s sales figures reflect its diversified product portfolio—from affordable passenger EVs to commercial vehicles and buses—which has allowed it to capture a larger share of the rapidly expanding global market.
	
•	Prominent voices like Charlie Munger have even remarked that in China, “BYD is so much ahead of Tesla that it’s almost ridiculous,” noting that while Tesla has been forced to reduce prices repeatedly, BYD has maintained a pricing discipline that reinforces its quality perception [ ￼].
	
2.	Integrated Vertical Model and Proprietary IP
	•	BYD’s business model is built on deep vertical integration. It manufactures everything from battery cells (including its innovative blade battery) to complete battery packs, ensuring tighter quality control, faster innovation cycles, and cost efficiencies.
	
•	In contrast, Tesla’s battery strategy still depends heavily on external suppliers such as CATL, Panasonic, and LG Energy Solution. While Tesla touts its in-house 4680 cell as revolutionary, independent analysis shows that its energy density improvements (in Wh/kg) are modest compared to the rapid progress made by competitors [see discussion below].
	
•	BYD’s extensive R&D and robust portfolio of patents in battery technology (and its willingness to license technology to other automakers) suggest that its technological edge isn’t just hype—it translates into real, scalable production improvements. Tesla’s reliance on external providers leaves it vulnerable if those suppliers or competing integrated players (like BYD) drive down costs and improve performance.
	
3.	Limited Technological Differentiation on Core Battery Metrics
	
•	A key metric for EV performance is energy density (Wh/kg). Despite much fanfare around Tesla’s battery innovations, the improvements in energy density aren’t dramatically superior to those achieved by BYD and other leading manufacturers.
	
•	This calls into question whether Tesla’s premium valuation—built largely on future expectations—can be sustained if its core battery technology isn’t materially better. BYD, on the other hand, combines modest improvements in battery performance with a proven, fully integrated production process that has already translated into higher sales volumes and broader market acceptance.
	
4.	The Overvaluation Argument and Market Sentiment
	
•	Tesla’s current market valuation appears to be based on an almost irrational optimism about future robotaxis, autonomous driving, and energy storage breakthroughs—none of which have yet materially improved the company’s profitability or production volumes.
	
•	With BYD now not only supplying its own vehicles but also securing contracts as a battery supplier for other major players (including recent agreements where BYD’s FinDreams unit is set to supply Tesla’s Shanghai energy storage facility [ ￼]), the narrative that Tesla is the sole leader in battery innovation is weakening.
	
•	When you combine lower vehicle sales numbers, an overreliance on third-party suppliers, and only modest improvements in battery performance, the rationale behind Tesla’s high valuation starts to crumble. Investors may eventually reprice Tesla based on its current fundamentals rather than its lofty future projections.

Conclusion

From this perspective, the argument for shorting Tesla centers on the idea that:
	
•	BYD’s strong global sales, robust vertical integration, and advanced battery IP are not only outpacing Tesla in key markets (especially in China) but also provide a more sustainable competitive advantage.
	
•	Tesla’s reliance on external suppliers and its relatively modest improvements in core battery metrics (like energy density) suggest that its premium valuation is built on an overly optimistic narrative.
	
•	If market sentiment shifts away from these future promises and begins to focus on near-term fundamentals, Tesla could see a significant correction.

1idb98p,Elon indicating battery production issues in earnings call today. Could possible acquisition be a solution for Tesla?,"TO ALL MY HIGH RISK SPECULATIVE INVESTORS!

I know some of you have probably heard about this juicy rumor floating around that Tesla might be looking at acquiring $QS and if you haven't, well its out there and Elon just stated the reason why on todays earnings call.

Elon said - ""Right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production, rather than demand."" So you know they're sweating bullets over their battery issues, working overtime to fix this shit.

Now, the issue is that Elon Musk has historically been content with lithium-ion batteries for Tesla's vehicles, citing the cost implications of adopting solid-state technology at scale. So in order for this rumor to come true and for QS to send us regards (myself included) to the multi-millionaire club, QS must be able to have a revolutionary solid-state Lithium battery AND be able to show that these batteries can be mass-produced cheaply at a large scale.

Just to be crystal clear: THIS IS A SUPER HIGH RISK play because there is a chance that $QS won't be able to figure out how to make these batteries affordable. As always, do your DD before you buy. 

Volkswagen has already made significant investments into $QS, but who the tf wants to drive an electric VW loaded with top-of-the-line revolutionary batteries anyways?

1ibbqer,Third Coast Bancshares: Continued Growth In A Booming Region,"I have been covering numerous small & mid cap banks for quite some time now and I am bullish on the continued growth of many names. TCBX is based in the high-growth Texas metropolitan areas with very impressive growth despite the fact Texas has more banks than any other state. Here is my analysis on this particular community bank:

Hope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company / the future outlook on financials

# Macro Overview:

* **Economic Strength of Texas:** Third Coast operates in Texas, whom remain one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. that recently [grew at 4.2% in Q3 2024](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)), faster than the nation as a whole. Business friendly policies like no state income tax, have helped corporate relocation's like Tesla, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard. Texas's economy is the [eighth-largest](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)) when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. Texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor Third Coast.
* **Impact of Potential Deregulation:** [Deregulation is expected to play a pivotal role](https://www.thebanker.com/content/05e97cf7-7d6a-580d-91cb-d27cd4d03092) in the new administrations economic agenda. For community banks like Third Coast, this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. With fewer regulatory requirements, Third Coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. Typically, the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. It allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. With deregulation almost certain, focusing on further risk-taking is important. This approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line.

# Investment Thesis:

* **Presence In A High-Growth Region:** Texas has one of the strongest economies in the U.S. consistently outpacing the national GDP growth rate. Third Coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a CAGR of over 25% and EPS growth of over 18% from 2020 to 2024. Deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. This will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. Third Coast's lending increased 9% to $3.97 billion. Urban centers like Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston are hubs for technology, energy, and manufacturing. In particular, residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations, jobs, and incomes.
* **Current Valuation:** Third Coast has a P/E (TTM) of 14.65, slightly below the [industry average of 14.8](https://simplywall.st/markets/us/financials/banks). Yet, the stock has risen over 93% in the last year alone and is just -2.5% from its 52-week high of $37.65. Despite the significant increase, Third Coast is still slightly undervalued. It is significantly under their five-year average high P/E of 16.9. With continued growth expected in the long-term, we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback, or continue holding.
* **Strong Financial Results:** Fierce competition in Texas is intense with hundreds of banks. Nevertheless, Third Coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 IPO. Revenue has increased 80%, EPS 194%, and net income 317%. Profitability metrics like return on average assets, return on average equity, and net profit margin have set new records. They have hit highs of 1.05%, 11.48%, and 27.82%, respectively. Nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7% to 0.58% of total assets. While increases are not desired, the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now.

# Loan Growth & Quality

* **Nonperforming loans:** Often, solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. Third Coast predominately lends to CRE and C&I, combined accounting for almost 60% of the total portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by 61.4% to $27.95 million. A large reason for such a major increase stemmed from C&I accounting for over 51% of nonperforming loans. Non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39%. Fortunately, non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans decreased -14% despite their 11.3% weighting.
* **Nonperforming assets:** Unsurprisingly, nonperforming assets increased by 48.7% as a result. Currently, nonperforming assets are only at 0.58% which is still minor for a community bank. We do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. They can easily start to wipe out a bank's equity. Third Coast has grown fantastically, as has nonperforming loans and assets. Both are now at all-time highs for the banks. We will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue.

# Earnings Overview

* **Revenue:** Fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16% to $171.38 million. Third Coast benefited from a 15.2% increase in net-interest income due to elevated interest rates. This allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. Floating-rate loans especially boosted interest income, despite rising deposit costs. Total non-interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4% to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue.
* **Net Income:** An impressive increase of 42.7% lead to a total of $47.67 million. This increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income, resulting from loan growth.
* **EPS:** Earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4% to $2.78. Higher revenue, controlled cost management, and rising profitability were the primarily reasons for such an increase.",2025-01-27 15:28:40,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibbqer/third_coast_bancshares_continued_growth_in_a/

Here's the dilemma I face. I firmly believe in long-term investing in S&P500 or Nasdaq100 index funds, and that's what I advise my clients to do for their retirement planning from their early age.

The problem arises with short- and medium-term investments. 

The more frequently my clients buy and sell individual stocks, the higher the fees I earn, which makes me wealthier. Leverage stocks like 3x tesla have much higher fees than index funds as you know.  

But clients who trade frequently tend to see lower returns over time. On the other hand, those who simply buy index funds consistently or hold onto blue-chip stocks like google or micorsoft for the long term usually achieve much better returns.

Of course, these long-term investors don’t generate as much revenue for me. Yet, I often find myself advising clients not to trade too often, even though I know this reduces my own income.

1hvvgf2,The potential AI stocks in 2025,"When think of AI stocks, the first names that come to my mind is $NVDA and $MSFT. NVIDIA dominates the AI hardware market with its GPU technology, while Microsoft, through its partnership with OpenAI, has become a benchmark in the AI software space.

Meanwhile, Applovin ($APP) has excelled in AI-driven advertising, with its stock price doubling in November, attracting widespread attention. But beyond these giants, there are still many ""hidden champions"" lurking among the small-cap stocks.

For example, $BBAI, which focuses on defense AI, and UiPath ($PATH), specializing in enterprise automation, have garnered attention from the capital markets due to their deep market positioning.

But, I am currently eyeing on $BGM's recent stock price fluctuations.

Recently, BGM completed its acquisition of AIFU’s insurance platform, marking a significant step in its transformation into the AI insurance sector. AIFU’s “DuXiaoBao” platform, powered by Baidu’s big data, is a prime example of such integration. It combines Baidu’s 704 million monthly active users with AIFU’s 48 million insurance sales network. Currently, the platform covers over 16.8 million customers and 17.5 million households. With BGM’s integration of medical resources, the user base and insurance coverage are expected to expand significantly, driving explosive growth for the company.

Traditional insurance sales rely on broker networks, but ""DuXiaoBao"" is changing the game by using Baidu and AIFU’s deep data models to offer tailored insurance solutions. In the future, it might even analyze users’ lifestyle and health data to predict their health risks over the next 30 years and design personalized insurance products based on that. Imagine if AI told you there was a 95% chance you’d be sick in the next 20-30 years and recommended an insurance product accordingly—would you buy it? This “smart + privacy” insurance sales model is truly disruptive.

This approach bears a striking similarity to Tesla’s innovation: Tesla used vehicle data to personalize car insurance, disrupting the traditional auto insurance industry, while BGM is using big data to empower insurance products, revolutionizing the customer experience.

Looking ahead, BGM might even leverage OpenAI’s technology to take the ""DuXiaoBao"" platform global, offering personalized health and insurance services to users worldwide. This vision of globalization and technological integration opens up even greater growth potential for the company.

BGM’s market cap is currently just around $60 million, compared to insurance giants like Prudential (market cap around $21.7 billion) and Prudential Financial (market cap around $46.1 billion), which are dozens of times its size.

1hvhjnt,Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets,"**Summary**

* Uber’s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber’s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google’s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber’s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber’s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google’s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber’s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber’s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber’s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta’s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber’s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility—including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access—support Uber’s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber’s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber’s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber’s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%—a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber’s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber’s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

1hvcot5,This is why we dont buy Chinese stocks: US Dept of Defense Labels Tencent a military company ,"
From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true):

The U.S. Department of Defense has added Tencent Holdings and CATL to its blacklist of companies allegedly linked to China's military, causing Tencent's U.S.-listed shares to drop nearly 10%. This move is part of the Pentagon's ""Section 1260H list,"" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.

Tencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.

While the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.

Both Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.

1hv5dc3,Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade),"**Summary**

* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.
* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.
* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla’s valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.
* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.
* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.

Tesla’s stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla’s market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla’s stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.

In my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla’s slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.

The most recent data on Tesla’s deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla’s streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company’s reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.

From 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla’s business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk’s magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla’s position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla’s stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump’s administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.

Tesla’s valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla’s market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla’s valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.

Tesla’s performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock’s overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla’s stock has outperformed Nvidia’s despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.

Although Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company’s market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.

In conclusion, Tesla’s stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company’s technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock’s near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla’s valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.

1hqy8vw,Bitcoin Isn’t Unique But Infinite—$100K Is Beyond Absurd,"Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it’s everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, “Only 21 million bottles will ever exist.” They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.

But here’s the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn’t just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it’s a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.

Think about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system—one consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants—to package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing—they are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin’s code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.

This brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.

Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.

Fiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers—companies, governments, or individuals—to repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.

Cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin’s 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing—no ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.

Bitcoin’s defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, “We’re only producing 21 million bottles.” The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.

The absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.

Bitcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin’s clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin’s price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren’t paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they’re paying because they believe someone else will pay more.

This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin’s features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.

Bitcoin isn’t digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It’s a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.

When the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin’s price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",2025-01-01 07:36:43,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqy8vw/bitcoin_isnt_unique_but_infinite100k_is_beyond/

I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

Be a Hidden Gem and at a Place When Tesla Was at $1.33 Only or When Bitcoin was but Mere Cents Only?,"Hi investing friends, could GOEV (Canoo inc., I've bought quite a significant number of shares at least significant for the budget; always with cross-referencing do your own research and trust your own instincts after the data, always doing due diligence and this is not financial advice) be a hidden gem and now at a place when Tesla was at $1.33 or when BTC was mere cents (Bitcoin even started at $0) about a decade and a half ago? It was ignored coz' no one was buying much. It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.'

1hfy0q8,Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes,"I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I’m going to blow your minds a little bit. 

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit. 

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price. 

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc. 

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990’s. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations, you bought low and sold high! Was what you participated in a Ponzi scheme because you (an old investor) made a profit by selling to a new investor?

I really hope your answer to this is no. If you think the answer is yes, you can stop reading here, because I don’t think anything I’m going to say beyond this point is going to help you.

The next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how ALL INVESTMENT RETURNS are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. This is true for non-dividend (which is the vast majority) stocks, derivatives, physical collectibles like pet rocks/beanie babies/tulip bulbs, and digital collectibles like in-game skins/NFTs/cryptocurrencies, etc. Examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks, direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you, or rental properties. It is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time, the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. The reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. It is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason, and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future.

So, what is a Ponzi? According to ChatGPT, a Ponzi scheme is “a fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. The scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. Eventually, the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time.”

That seems like a pretty good definition to me! The part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a Ponzi is this part: “the scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.” This sounds extremely similar to my charizard example, yet I hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real Ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high. 

The part that is extremely important, in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors, is that the scheme PROMISES a return. The reality is that many Ponzi schemes do not start off as Ponzi schemes. There are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in Ponzi-like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn, and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. Doing this is quite risky and is still illegal, because if you aren’t able to essentially over deliver (and underpromise) on future returns to even things out, you’re essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money, turning your once legitimate investment fund into a Ponzi scheme. The right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you’re able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the Ponzi-loop I described. 

Another attribute of Ponzi schemes is that Ponzi’s almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. This is because once a Ponzi stops attracting new money, it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets. 

**Example 2.** Imagine a hypothetical Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi fund initially accepted $1,000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. The fund manager promises a 10% annual yield so that in 1 year’s time, any of the original investors can withdraw $1,100, if they so please. Unfortunately, our manager really sucks at operating this Ponzi, and after 1 year, obtains exactly zero new clients. His liabilities at the end of the year are now $11,000, but he only has $10,000 of cash on hand. Even more unfortunately for him, Taylor Swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now, and the tickets incidentally cost $1,100. All his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. The first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back ($1,100 x 9 = $9,900). When the 10th person comes back, he realizes there’s only $100 for him, not the $1,100 he was promised! The fund not only has basically no money left, it owes $1000. The 10th person notifies the police, and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud. 

I will note that in this example, this scheme required 90% of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse, but examples in history tend to be much more skewed, where even a small withdrawal of 1-5% of investors can completely collapse the scheme.

Returning to the investable object definition, once a Ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors, the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects (that could be sold on an open market for hopefully higher than you originally paid for) actually had a negative cash balance the entire time! Behind the curtain, there actually was no object at all. This is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. The charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10,000 to $1. Maybe everyone collectively realizes Pokemon is super lame, and that Yugioh is the superior card game. At the end of the day, there are two truths: you still own the investable object aka the charizard, and no one promised you a return for owning it. You can always wait it out, hoping that people become interested in charizards (and Pokemon) again. 

I hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating Ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. I often see CLEARLY non-Ponzi investable objects being echo-chambered as Ponzi’s on Reddit, when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object, or the mechanics of investment itself. If your investable object trades on an open market, and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics, it is almost certainly not a Ponzi. If nobody is promising you a return, it also probably isn’t a Ponzi. This does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. That determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. I will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this. 

**Example 3.** Tesla stock is neither a Ponzi (trades on open market) nor a scam (they actually sell cars, batteries, etc for a profit). It might be a bubble if you think the company’s market cap is too high for what its future profits will be.

**Example 4.** Nikola stock is not a Ponzi (stock traded on open market), but it was a scam. The CEO lied to investors about how functional the cars were (they weren’t), and how many they sold (pretty much zero).",2024-12-17 00:24:17,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfy0q8/ponzi_spotting_a_laymens_guide_to_differentiating/
1hfs25j,"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money","I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks ""uninvestible"" if that makes you trade.",2024-12-16 20:02:39,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfs25j/reminder_if_you_trade_more_wall_street_makes_more/
1hfr8dz,Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

My next goal will be to reach $300,000 invested by the end of 2026. What do you all think? Achievable?",2024-12-16 19:27:44,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfr8dz/achieved_my_first_milestone_after_3_years/
1hfprfx,Savings Diversity - General Questions,"So I have a general question about the cash that I'm keeping on hand.

I have about 40K in savings right now. Here is the breakdown:

33K in a HYS (3.8 APY)

6K in a different HYS (6.5 APY but I can only add 2K per month so I have an automatic transfer from the 3.8 account into this one. Every year the money all gets kicked out in August so it's a constant cycle)

$750 initially invested right now (650 in VTI/VOO ETFS - 100 in Tesla Stock)

I have about 13k in retirement as well (70% low risk 30% moderate risk)

Should I have more of my money invested into S&P ETFs that would likely outpace the 3.9 HYS? What do you think my diversity should be between all of these options? Are there other options I should look into?",2024-12-16 18:26:39,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfprfx/savings_diversity_general_questions/
1hfjvh8,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

1hcqtr1,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I’ve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because “everyone” said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t trading rationally. I’d look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn’t offset the losses caused by Bitcoin’s decline, PaySafe’s terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin’s recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn’t capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I’ve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I’ve set specific rules to guide me:

1. I Avoid Speculative Investments
I now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto, IPO stocks, or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor, keeping my greed under control.  

2. I Reject Market Timing
I no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to “buy low today and sell high tomorrow” because it’s too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations, but it requires too much time and still, offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not, it doesn’t pay off.

3. Focus on Debt-to-Equity
In the past, I ignored the debt-to-equity ratio. Now, I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels.

4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure
I cap my individual stock picks at 5% of my total portfolio. Previously, this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in, leading to choosing assets that were just “okay” rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully, with most of my portfolio now in the S&P 500, individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index.

5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value
My approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, they become my choice.

I hope these rules will help me sleep well at night, keep me from obsessing over financial news, and generate decent returns that complement the S&P 500.",2024-12-12 17:51:03,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hcqtr1/returning_to_active_stock_portfolio_management/

1h9i57c,"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.","Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. 

  
4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.

  
5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. 

in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.

  
I think Rivian makes a fantastic product, and there's a bright future ahead for them.",2024-12-08 12:47:50,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h9i57c/im_bullish_on_rivian_and_here_is_why/
1h4063m,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

1h3z7qg,Thoughts on Tesla in December,"So right after Tesla recently reached it's ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it's current correction.

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so.

1h2syee,Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born,"Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

1h28t5b,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

1h2886i,the TRUTH about investing no one tells you,"# 1. The system is rigged

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there’s **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who’s really winning here? Hint: it’s not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn’t about being the smartest—it’s about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here’s your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it’s easy to find the next Tesla? It’s not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can’t value the stock, you can’t invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can’t invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it’s incredibly hard—think Charlie Munger-level hard.**

  
**What this all means**

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn’t mean you can’t win.The winners aren’t the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""—they’re the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

1jz0rgj,"Trade Wars and Treasuries, or, How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds
(A longform ELI5 explainer on why the bond market is reacting — and why that's dangerous)","OK Reddit, I have been asked to synthesize a few ELI5 posts I made over the past week into an explainer, because folks found them helpful.  Believe me, it’s an exciting action story, covering the fall of Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, and some face-punching.  And you’ll learn why people in the know are worried. 

**TL;DR**: Bond yields aren’t just a number — they’re a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, it’s not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Here’s why that’s dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power.

## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds***

Over the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.  However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot.  The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market “queasiness."" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. 

## **What is a Treasury Bond?**

Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That “little extra” is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. It’s an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time.  So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more.

Let’s say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield.

Why does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand.

Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield! 

As you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely.

This is worth emphasizing:  The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8).

- If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11.

- If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11.

- If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11.

The reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return.   Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields.

Why would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)?  Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature!  Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere.  Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts.

## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?**

Remember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it can’t offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Think about it this way:  Imagine you’re a builder in a town called Springville. For years, you’ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom.

Here’s the issue: You can’t continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers won’t be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000?

If you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, you’ll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere.

You might say:  Well, so what? I don’t care what the government pays in interest.  Not my problem!

*Oh, it is very, very much your problem.*

This is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark.  Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That’s bad for:

- **Homebuyers** – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

- **Businesses** – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

- **The government** – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

- **The stock market** – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It’s a double whammy.

That’s why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely — because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.

## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?**

I want to say “just because” — but that wouldn’t satisfy you.

It’s not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but it’s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.

Treasuries (so far) are considered “risk-free.” They’re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they’re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.

Imagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there’s plenty of data on what rate people charge him — and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.

Then Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don’t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. That’s how the market treats borrowers — it builds off the known “risk-free” rate.

But why the 10-year treasury specifically? It’s not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans.

Many countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally.  In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts don’t key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; it’s seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone.  Other examples include:

- UK 10-year Gilt – a common benchmark for domestic British rates.

- Japanese 10-year  – used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy.

- Chinese 10-year – also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent.

These bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist.

The US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes:

- Deep liquidity

- Transparent, market-based pricing

- Long track record of stability

- Dollar dominance — many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated

- Safe-haven status during global crises

When benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score.  If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. That’s why predictability is essential — investors need confidence, not surprises.

## **So It’s Good to Be Randy Reliable?**

Yes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollar’s position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly.  Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably.

However, there’s a downside:

A strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad.

That’s why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it.  Yet, it’s a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S.  A good article discussing all this can be found here:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar.

## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?**

Now you’re getting it.  The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership.

So what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends?  Well, suddenly he doesn’t seem like such a safe person to lend to. 

This is why the “long part of the curve” for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy.  Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless?  That’s the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem.  I’ll get to that in a bit.

## **The Yield is the Entire Field**

So, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership.  As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower.  So the rates they’re comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. 

Typically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN.  That’s because long treasuries – lending to Randy Reliable – have always been regarded as a safe haven.  Remember, it represents the risk-free rate!  When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place.  More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines.

But that’s not what we saw last week!  Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing.  That was… weird.  The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven.  That’s a scary thought.  It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. 

## **Wasn’t I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?**

Aren’t higher long-term bond yields a good thing?  You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign.  That’s when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds.  This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk.  More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you.  This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. 

An inverted yield curve is a signal.  It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring.  Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety – like Randy Reliable – leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, it’s still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself.

Rising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness.

That’s not a recession signal. That is the disease.

That’s a sovereign confidence event.

Different animal. Nastier teeth.

## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?**

Now, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion.  Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot.

Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply won’t be enough buyers with cash ready, and that’s what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases.

## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers**

Conversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts.  They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers.  And China, Japan, and Canada wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.

The Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.

China is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.  So are Canada and Japan.  Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there.  

The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

When the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, that’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies,  encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests.

This is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump’s policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power.

## **Can’t the Fed Do Something?**

Yes and no, but not really.  Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries — that’s what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE).

But there’s a catch: it’s much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility.

When the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable.

If the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire — driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall.

So yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets.

## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?**

After reading this primer, many have suggested, why don’t we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them!

No, we do not have that power.  Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt?  Because that’s how you do it.  This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip.

It’s as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies.  So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding China’s notes makes about as much sense.  It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about.    

As an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000.

I decide I hate Peter and tell him I’m not paying back his loan and that I won’t repay it if he sells it to anyone else.  Peter’s loan becomes worthless.  This situation is called a default. 

Charlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well.  So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they don’t trust me.

The value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back.

Now, I go out to the market and ask for more loans.  Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates.

## **What Can We Do?**

Ultimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust.  Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order.  Trust comes from relationships and time.

There’s an old adage:  Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain.  We are witnessing that in real time.  Restoring trust may well take decades now.  There will be no easy fix.  Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead.

1jgkamz,TSLA Fair Value Analysis: The bull The Bear . The case for the 140 and 180 Valuation,"

TL;DR: Tesla is significantly overvalued at current levels ($240). Fair value range $140-180 based on deteriorating growth metrics, declining margins, and elevated valuation multiples. Current prices require near-perfect execution on unproven future tech bets.

---

I've been watching the Tesla story unfold for years, and recent developments demand a sober reassessment of the stock's fair value. After diving into the latest financials and operational metrics, I believe the market is significantly overestimating Tesla's near-term prospects.

Current Market Sentiment vs. Financial Reality

While Wall Street maintains an average price target around $310-340, I see a serious disconnect with Tesla's financial performance:

Stagnant Growth: 2024 revenue grew a meager 0.95% YoY, with the company posting its first-ever annual delivery decline
Margin Compression: Q4 operating margin fell to 6.2%, down from 8.2% a year earlier, as Tesla sacrifices profitability for volume
Valuation Stretch: Currently trading at 161x P/E - astronomical even for a growth company, especially one showing signs of maturation

The Cybertruck Debacle: Canary in the Coal Mine

The Cybertruck situation isn't just about recalls or insurance challenges - it exposes fundamental issues with Tesla's execution:

* Production challenges with new materials and manufacturing techniques
* Price points that severely limit market potential (originally pitched as a mass-market vehicle)
* Sales volumes falling dramatically short of projections (40K annually vs. Musk's 250K target)

Why $140-180 is Fair Value

A 40-50% downside from current levels might seem extreme, but consider:

1. Rational Multiples: A 50-75x P/E would still be generous for a company with stalled growth and margin pressure. This alone justifies significant contraction.

2. Auto Industry Fundamentals: Legacy automakers typically trade at 5-15x earnings. Even with Tesla's energy business and software potential, a 100% premium to industry leaders feels more appropriate than the current 1000%+ premium.

3. Valuation Models Agree: Discounted cash flow analyses consistently show fair value around $150, with some sophisticated models suggesting even lower targets.

## Profiting From This View

Options for bulls(No not Caesars legion)  :
* Reduce position sizes to limit exposure
* Sell covered calls to generate income while holding core positions
* Focus on defined-risk options strategies rather than outright stock ownership

For bears (No not the NCR ):
* Consider put spreads 6+ months out to avoid short-term volatility
* Focus on strike prices in the $180-200 range for optimal risk/reward

For neutral investors(Finally I escape the FNV brain rot ) :
* Wait for better entry points in the $140-180 range
* Use cash-secured puts at those levels to potentially acquire shares at even better prices

Risk Factors To My Thesis

I acknowledge several potential upside catalysts:

* The affordable model (expected H1 2025) could exceed volume expectations
* FSD/robotaxi progress could accelerate more quickly than anticipated
* Trump administration policies could benefit Tesla's competitiveness
* Energy storage business could see inflection point in growth/margins

## Bottom Line

The market is pricing Tesla as if every ambitious future project will succeed perfectly. History shows that even the most visionary companies encounter delays, setbacks, and execution challenges. A fair valuation needs to account for these risks.

At $140-180, Tesla would still command a premium valuation that respects its innovation potential while acknowledging the very real headwinds it faces in 2025-2026.

1j4b2bx,How to remove exposure to an index component,"We seem to be getting a lot of the same question recently about how to remove exposure of an index component if someone holds an index fund.

Whether it's NVDIA because you think there's an AI bust coming. Or you don't want to own TSLA because of Musk - there are ways to remove exposure of a component in an index.

First - the easiest way to do that is to not hold that fund and find a different fund that fits your criteria.

But if you want to hold certain types of indices such as large cap indices but you want to exclude a large cap component - it is a bit more difficult.

These are the different ways from most complicated to simplest.

1. Roll synthetic short futures with equivalent negative delta.
2. Write equivalent negative delta using deep otm call credit spreads or naked calls.
3. Short the equivalent dollar amount of shares
4. Roll long short puts or put debit spreads.
5. If an inverse ETP exists, buy the dollar equivalent of the inverse ETP.
6. Use a model-based replication service (usually only avail through an SMA/UMA program) which supports trade restrictions.
7. Use a direct index solution which supports rebalancing. 

Some of these solutions require more trading effort and derivatives experience than the average investor. So unless you are familiar - don't do it. And it's not possible to use some of these techniques in retirement accounts.

For most investors - the simplest is #6 or #7. Many brokers offer direct indexing and/or managed accounts - for example:

1izkzc2,"Curious about TSLA and co-mingling with SpaceX, Twitter, and Starlink","Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).  And has been sued for trying to manipulate stock prices [through outrageous claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-sec-lawsuit-twitter-d2640adc) and [non-disclosure](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musk-sued-by-twitter-investors-delayed-disclosure-stake-2022-05-26/).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?  I mean, when most companies spin off another entity, there's usually some sort of compensation, right?  Stock, payments, etc.",2025-02-27 17:16:32,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1izkzc2/curious_about_tsla_and_comingling_with_spacex/

Between the “Sieg Heil” incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he’s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla’s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** – Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that’s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** – Tesla’s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that’s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** – The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s next big thing, but it’s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it’s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** – Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla’s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** – Tesla’s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there’s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** – Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** – Tesla’s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** – Tesla’s alignment with Musk’s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla’s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they’re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I’ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

What do you think? Am I missing something, or is Tesla headed for some rough times ahead?",2025-02-12 16:02:59,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1inu9y7/is_the_tesla_bubble_about_to_pop/

Previously been 100% in crypto and it’s time to get a bit less volatile and more traditional in my investment strategy. I’m new to this, so help me out. I’m 30, looking for medium low risk, and plan to hold long term, minimum 10years, max 30. I want simplicity, growth, stability, and to be confident in my holdings. Here’s my portfolio set up:

Brokerage 
- 50% VOO
- 20% QQQM
- 10% NVDA
- 10% GOOG
- 10% TSLA

The individual stocks are ones I believe in and want extra exposure too, yes not simple and there’s overlap, but I’m confident in them. 

Roth IRA
- 75% VTI
- 25% SCHD

I could do more growth in Roth, but I just love the SCHD dividend dopamine and “game” of trying to accumulate SCHD. Even though it may not be optimal for growth, it feels good.

1hvhjnt,Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets,"**Summary**

* Uber’s stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber’s strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google’s Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber’s stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber’s advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google’s evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber’s investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber’s ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber’s management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta’s successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber’s business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility—including cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access—support Uber’s long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber’s margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber’s EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber’s revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%—a compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber’s forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber’s long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

1huvcpj,Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested **€10 per week** in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can’t remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn’t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It’s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of **€520** throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is **€706.80**, which means a profit of **€186.80** (+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:** Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:** The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:** I didn’t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It’s just my experience—not right, not wrong—just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

**Discussion**:  
Has anyone else here tried investment ""experiments"" like this? How did it go for you?

1hgl6bo,"First time beating the SP500 in 3 years. Also, reached my second goal of half a milli","I started investing in November 2017 and I was doing great during the bull run. Unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and I spent 3 years kicking myself thinking I should've just put everything on SPY and forget it. In the last few months I can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again. At some point during December 2022 my portfolio was -35% while in comparison if I had put it on SPY I would still be positive. This traumatized me a bit and now that I am finally beating the index over the last 7.2 years I have three main thoughts:

1. Is the volatility worth it?  
2. I'm up on some names anything from 200-800% which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

>\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",2024-12-16 14:08:16,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfjvh8/25_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/

1h5wads,Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",2024-12-03 19:49:45,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h5wads/investment_advice_rebalancing/
1h4063m,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

1h2syee,Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born,"Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

I have just finished reading The Misbehaviour of Markets by Mandelbrot, and I immediately started looking for libraries in Python to do data analysis using his suggested metrics.

To my surprise, I couldn't find any. So, first question, did I not search properly? What do you use?

Therefore, I started developing mine :)  
But I am having problems with the Hurst exponent/scalability (it is utilized to evaluate the extent of long-term reliance in market predictability), I don't understand how to interpret the results or there is a bug in the code (less likely, or in the data).

1ginwra,The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA,"Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

1g4cmvs,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

1ey1gi0,Next Steps with Rebalance and Growth,"I posted a couple weeks ago seeking some advice on a 3 fund portfolio and bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elrna2/3_fund_portfolio_bond_advice/).  Got lots of great feedback, and now that I have digested it all - I'm looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle.  The gist of it was:

  
*$5M portfolio, heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA (80%) with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*

What I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?  Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years?  I don't plan on selling everything, but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds.",2024-08-21 21:23:57,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ey1gi0/next_steps_with_rebalance_and_growth/
1exblh8,Should I be riskier in my Roth or my normal brokerage?,"I have been researching Roth IRAs as I turn 18  in a few months. I’ve seen conflicting information on investment strategies for your Roth. 

I had originally thought to use the Roth for “safer” holds like VOO and QQQ but have been seeing some people say to put risk in a Roth and safe in a normal brokerage. I just want to see what you guys do so I can give myself some context to make my own decision.

I already have a normal brokerage that holdd VOO, QQQ, UPRO, NEE, DVN, TSLA, and BITU

I also am very heavy in crypto (85% BTC and 5% ETH), so I am definitely holding a fairly aggressive portfolio for some context. I was thinking holding mostly etfs in my Roth and individual stocks in my brokerage. Let me know what you think of that approach and what yours is",2024-08-21 00:21:19,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1exblh8/should_i_be_riskier_in_my_roth_or_my_normal/
1eoj9sr,I’m about to buy high - sell low. How can I take advantage of the loss?,"I’m finally realizing my TSLA stock, which I once thought would go through the roof, will not reach my estimated potential. I will sell them before year end along with another dog stock I have held for too long for a combined loss of $40K. 

Most discussions of tax loss or capital gains harvesting would be concerned with what I do with the cash from that sale, but I have a different question. I have NVDA shares which have appreciated $40K, and I have held them for more than a year. Does it make sense to take my profit now in order to have a net-zero transaction? Is this a mechanism for taking my profit in NVDA without owing additional taxes as if I sold it in retirement?",2024-08-10 03:29:39,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eoj9sr/im_about_to_buy_high_sell_low_how_can_i_take/
1elrna2,3 Fund Portfolio / Bond Advice,"I'm 44 years old and have about $5M in my Schwab accounts. Around $1M is in SNAXX money market, taking advantage of the high interest rates, and the rest is in stocks and mutual funds. My largest holdings are in AAPL and TSLA, accounting for about $3M.

I spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I'm ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions (\~$2666/month for my wife and me) from buying stocks to something else. He suggested the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio, which seems like a good fit. I've also been reading about the 3-fund portfolio.

So, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:

1. **Feedback on SIP vs. 3-fund portfolio?** If I go with the 3-fund portfolio, should I stick with the Schwab options listed on the Bogleheads wiki, or is there a better way to choose the funds?
2. **Advice on moving $500K from SNAXX to bonds:** I'm ready to move half of the $1M in SNAXX to bonds in preparation for interest rates coming down, so I can lock in some good returns for the next 5 years. Any recommendations on what I should consider buying?

I've done well so far by just buying stocks, but this is a bit out of my expertise, so I would love some guidance. Thanks!",2024-08-06 20:03:48,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elrna2/3_fund_portfolio_bond_advice/
1ehnkfo,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1e22yfr,What is biggest risks to Yield Max ETF?,"I trade actively (futures/options) and have different accounts for different reasons (i.e: long term/IRA/401K/day trading/swing trading/YOLO account as well) so my financial literature is relatively well, but I still dont see the biggest risks to yield max ETF, which is selling covered calls and selling cash secured puts on many famous stocks such as TSLA/NVDA

Those have good return, so I have been buying IRA, since taxes wont apply until withdrawal in retirement. 

  
I understand how they will pay out the dividend in theory and actually I use similar strategy in SPY but whats the biggest risk here? 

My best guess is that individual stocks goes to 0, by which Yield Max ETF will go into 0, but it's hard to imagine that NVDA will go to 0 in any time soon, since they are dealing with big tech or big name stocks with good financial statement and pretty much too big to fail business (i.e: DIS/JPM) 

That makes me think there is virtually no risks but apparently, it sounds too good to be true, and I am getting cautious. Are there anything I should know on this kind of ETFs?

1dpbvd3,Safe starting plan to get into Futures? As well as what to do with my ROTH? ,"Hello all, I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in, and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old.

Firstly, for some background, I started trading maybe back in 2022, I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL, TSLA, LMT, etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck, these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes, I know not to take advice from TikTok lol.

Fast forward to now, I havent touched the account since then, and opening it I have made a return of about 16% with about $400 in total open P&L. Which I feel like is good? maybe? I don't know.

Anyways the reason I'm making this post is because I'm interested in short term profits, I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling, and so it's always been a ""I'll learn how to get into it later"", but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works, and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it:

1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm? Especially if I am just starting out/don't have a trading strategy? Or would I be better off starting with micros & my own money?
2. On that note, how do I go about developing a trade strategy? Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one? My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol
3. What should I use to trade futures? I have heard that Ninjatrader is good.

And the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped, mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in.

People have told me VOO > SPY, but then some others said $FXAIX > $VOO. Which, if any, is true? Should I invest in all 3? Also, is $200 a month enough? Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually? Does it really matter?

I realize this post is all over the place and I apologize, but it's all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward.

1diefni,NVDA after stock split won’t be like TSLA,"
Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let’s look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well.",2024-06-18 01:13:47,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1diefni/nvda_after_stock_split_wont_be_like_tsla/

1dbiohg,Why is there such risk aversion?  98% VOO +2% high-risk outperforms with minimal risk or volatility?  (Genuine question!),"I don't know if it's the bubbles I'm in or what social media feeds me, but it seems like everyone is either a high-stakes crypto/AI gambler, or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever.

I haven't used the particular tracker before, but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high-risk plays for a two percent allocation (Bitcoin and Tesla).  I think there's no denying these were highly volatile and highly-valued.  But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio.

But the returns were several percent better than VOO/SPDR.  And a 98% VOO +2% high-risk also outperforms BrkB, while being significantly more diversified.

I think anyone who's trying to ""play it safe"" would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3% by only risking 2% of their allocation.

(I haven't tried it but suspect you could have a portfolio of 70% bonds 30% high-risk and do well with a capped drawdown).

All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD). 

Peloton was a big loser and the only one I almost immediately regretted, but it was a relatively small investment that was more than offset by others.

* **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** -2.98%
* **ARM (ARM):** -1.88%
* **Intel (INTC):** -1.42%
* **Microsoft (MSFT):** +2.32%
* **Tesla (TSLA):** -0.54%

I know these are all less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I’m still well within the ‘maybe I’m just lucky’ phase since it’s only been a couple years, but I’ve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past: 

1. Insight 
2. Conviction 
3. Patience

**Insight**

I’ve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views). 

Ben Graham’s quote rings true: 

>“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”

Perhaps counterintuitively, I’ve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers. 

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both. 

# Math

In 2023 I also started practicing math daily (243 days straight as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I’d done any meaningful math. 

I’m not sure how much, but it *feels* like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not. 

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term. 

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths. 

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I’ve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I’m not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I’m happy I did. 

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial. 

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise, you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I’m much more patient in my investing these days and don’t react to the day-to-day. 

I wouldn’t be surprised if I don’t make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%. The annual rate of return (per my Vanguard dashboard) is 77.9% as mentioned in the original post.

First of all. Do you think is it realistic that self driving takes over and becomes a normal thing?

With the progress of technology we’re really not that far, fsd 12.3.4 is doing really good and we probably full self driving without supervision could be legal in the next 10-20 years.

If it does, we’ll be having an interesting progress of :

- TSLA : will may be in the top 10; actually they’re selling the self driving as a subscription of 99$ monthly, what if every Tesla owner have this feature?

UBER : if Uber replace all drivers by self driving cars. They’ll be saving all payrolls and injecting it to develop other delivery business (could be drones delivery; maybe I went too far but it’s feasible).  There’s a lot of potential and whatever between 45$-55$ is a good buy price.

1jve93c,Repost: It's all about China,"**Mods removed this post yesterday when it had 700 upvotes, probably because it became too political. Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**

**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**

DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.

  
“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**\^ this was posted on 2025-04-08 2:12PM ET.**

**""TRUMP HAS NO INTENTION TO KEEP UNJUSTIFIABLY HIGH TARIFFS ON EVERYONE ELSE BESIDES CHINA"" --me**

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

1jv0l7a,It looks like somebody saved Musk from a margin call in 2022,"Let's reiew some details around Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. On April 14th, 2020, Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter. Initially, Twitter resisted the proposal. Six days after the initial announcement (April 20th), Musk announced he'd secured funding for the deal, funding which, according to a [commitment letter from Morgan Stanley](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922049844/tm2213189d8_ex99-i.htm), included a $12.5 billion margin loan against Musk's TSLA stock. Then, on April 25th, Twitter dropped its opposition to the proposal and accepted Musk's offer.

But the $12.5 billion margin loan never happened. And I find the timeline of how it didn't happen very interesting. On May 4th, Musk announced [revised financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922056055/tm2214608-1_sc13da.htm) which cut the margin loan to $6.25 billion. Then on May 13th Musk announced was the deal ""on hold"", before two hours later saying he was ""Still committed to acquisition"". But this left people wondering what the hell Musk was doing. Then on May 24th Musk announced [new financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922064655/tm2216931d1_sc13da.htm) with no margin loan. At the time, financial columnist Matt Levine [interpreted this as proof](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-26/elon-called-off-his-margin-loan) that Musk was just kidding about the deal being ""on hold"". After all, it's not like putting a deal that's already been signed ""on hold"" is a thing in the M&A world anyway.

Except then in July, Musk's lawyers sent Twitter a letter, [made public in an SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm), saying they really were terminating the deal based on alleged breach of contract on Twitter's part. Twitter sued, and Musk looked ready to fight, before finally going ahead with the acquisition in October.

It's a good thing (for Musk, anyway) that the margin loan never happened. According to the commitment letter, the $12.5 billion loan would've been against $62.5 billion in TSLA stock, and would be subject to a margin call if the loan value ever exceeded 35% of the value of the collateral. Furthermore, on January 3rd of the following year, TSLA closed below $325/share, and almost fell below $305/share three days later before recovering. (TSLA has since undergone a 3:1 stock split, so if you're comparing to the current price, think of this as almost hitting $100/share.) Under the original financing plan for the Twitter deal, this almost certainly would have result in a margin call, since in the entire month of October, when the deal closed, the stock had never fallen below $600/share (or $200/share in split-adjusted terms).

Then, in a coda almost nobody noticed, Tesla released the [proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312523094075/d451342ddef14a.htm) for its 2023 shareholder meeting, which included a section on ""Board Responsiveness"", which stated, ""We have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters... As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to... Amending our pledging policy to... cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock"". No such policy was mentioned in the [2022 proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459022022992/tsla-pre14a_20220804.htm), obviously—it would've made the original proposal to acquire Twitter with a $12.5 billion margin loan impossible.

Taken together, all of this makes me think that *somebody* freaked out when Musk announced his original plan to finance the Twitter acquisition, and basically told him, ""what the fuck? No, you can't do that"". When billionaires get margin called, it can absolutely tank the stock price, which is probably why the commitment letter set such a relatively low threshold (35%) for triggering a margin call.

I think what happened in May 2022 is Musk initially tried to placate whoever was telling him ""fuck no"" by cutting the size of the loan in half, and when they weren't placated he tried to back out fo the deal, because he made the offer when he thought he could do the deal entirely with borrowed money and got cold feet when faced with the prospect of actually having to sell, rather than just borrow against, his TSLA stock to get the deal done. But in telling Musk ""fuck no"", whoever it was **saved Musk from himself and a margin call**.

It doesn't really matter who the ""somebody"" was, though I can't help but wonder if it was Tesla's largest shareholder—Vanguard. While known mainly for pioneering index funds, not noisy activist investing, and while I have never heard of them *starting* a proxy fight, Vanguard 100% *will* side with activist investors in proxy fights if they feel it's warranted. And they much more frequently ""engage"" with companies, and when your largest shareholder engages with you, you take it seriously, even when the engagement is phrased as polite suggestions. So I wonder if all the will-he-or-won't-he drama about acquiring Twitter in 2022 was because Vanguard wasn't happy with Musk's original plan.

Anyway, none of this means a Musk margin call is *impossible*, but I suspect it could only happen if Tesla was publicly known to be at risk of bankruptcy. I company is in serious trouble, but if you're betting against it (as I am), don't suddenly start getting careless if, say, the stock price drops to $120/share and there's a rumor going around further drops are a sure bet because Musk is getting margin called.

(Bloomberg) — One of Wall Street’s most bullish Tesla Inc. analysts slashed his price target for the stock by 43%, citing a brand crisis created by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump’s trade policies.

“Tesla has essentially become a political symbol globally,” Daniel Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who’s rated the carmaker’s shares a buy for the last four years, wrote in a report to clients Sunday. “It is time for Musk to step up, read the room, and be a leader in this time of uncertainty.”

Ives reduced his Tesla share-price target to $315 from $550, which had been the second-highest among the 72 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

Ives’ biggest concern is the potential for Tesla to get caught up in backlash against the US president’s tariff policies in China, where Tesla generated more than a fifth of its revenue last year. President Xi Jinping’s government plans to impose a 34% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10, matching the level of Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs on Chinese products.

“This will further drive Chinese consumers to buy domestic such as BYD, Nio, Xpeng and others,” Ives said in his note issued Sunday. “We now estimate Tesla has lost/destroyed at least 10% of its future customer base globally based on self-created brand issues, and this could be a conservative estimate.”

Tesla shares plunged 15% in the two days after Trump announced he would apply at least a 10% tariff on all countries’ imports into the US, with even higher duties on some 60 nations to counter trade imbalances. The stock has fallen 50% from its record high reached Dec. 17.",2025-04-06 19:11:38,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jt1wa9/tesla_bull_slashes_stock_price_target_43_citing/

1jps2rr,Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs,"(Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

So i was digging up, looking for the next under the radar big movers and i think I've got something.

VITESSE ENERGY, a non-operating gas and oil company. 

let me explain, recently they posted earning wich missed big time due to their recent acquisition of Lucero energy. At the same they issued their quartermy dividend and the whole market was panik red.

You get the point, they were ""unrightfully"" oversold.

So my theory is that it can, in a matters of month rebound to a price around 26-27 due to these :

1- oversold yet fundamentals are good

2- in case of uncertain and bearish market investor tend to like energy stock and you can see a rise in volume

3- they focus on domestic production wich can be boosted by the tax war, focus on april 2

4- 90% of reddit talk about Raw material or some goofy biotech with the 35th potential cure for cancer or whatever

5- insiders are stock pilling like crazy

Position : 400 april-17 25c  snatched at 0.13ct not selling until 10 baggers, might revise depending on momentum and market.
I recomend going on a longer date now that monday was a big green stick

1jiqjas,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.",2025-03-24 13:22:21,wallstreetbets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-bmw-group-electric-cars-114132432.html

But even after the recent drop, the P/E ratio is still around 110-120.

Doesn't that mean it would take 110 years of profit to buy the entire company at the current stock price?


What technology or product is going to come online that will make Tesla's profit increase ten fold?


For fuck sake, it is a car company ... And they have never sold that many cars when you compare to other car companies.


Someone that truly believes in the stock, explain to me like I am 5 why it will be more valuable in the future.

1jfwuvf,It’s time to call bullshit,"I’ll share a screenshot of my positions in a thread below, so if that’s all you’re here for go ahead and look.

My fellow regards, I believe it’s time to call bullshit on this market. Please understand, I don’t care who you voted for… I guarantee I like you a hell of a lot more than I like the banks, and that is exactly who the winner is going to be unless people wake up to the reality of our situation quickly. 

Before touching any kind of political news, let’s start with market indicators. 

BofA’s recent mm survey showed that most MM’s are reducing their share of US equities (source 1 below), there are other signs the banks are getting out as well (check my second to last post), BlackRock is struggling to find buyers. 

At the same time, a record number of American households now own stock in US equities (source 2 below). Now, from what I know about American households (I live in one), most of us live paycheck to paycheck… we don’t really have money to put into stocks willy-nilly.


So what does all of this mean? 

Well, my thesis is that the average American has their rent/mortgage in US equities tied up in stocks like Tesla right now as an act of patriotism… what saddens me most is that I appreciate this general sentiment (not for Tesla necessarily, but I do actually love my country despite what the news may tell you), but the banks are taking advantage of it. So what happens when all the sudden everyone has to pay their bills? 

That’s right… another mass sell off. 

Please believe me when I say that I hope I’m wrong, this is not going to be good for average, working people with, at the very least, good-hearted intentions… but I don’t see any signs to indicate that I am.

Now we’ll touch a bit on economic outlook and history:

We are currently still in a battle with inflation, JPow said it yesterday, even before tariffs we were looking at 2 more years before we return to normal and the outlook with tariffs puts it all on pause. He hedged to say ‘they aren’t sure how tariffs will affect inflation’, let me fill in the gap there: either tariffs will affect inflation (because the costs are passed on to consumers) or they will affect earnings (because companies absorb them)… the money has to come from somewhere. If it affects inflation, the fed will be forced to raise interest rates or at the very least pause on cuts indefinitely. If it doesn’t affect inflation, it will affect earnings/growth… if this sounds familiar, then you may have heard of stagflation. And if you study the history of the federal reserve, you may know what the solution to that problem is… Volcker’s hammer. You can look it up yourself but the gist is that in the late 70’s we had been battling inflation and stagnant growth for years, until Paul Volcker was appointed to head the federal reserve and raised interest rates to 20%… it absolutely crushed the economy, sent us to the stone ages… but it did reset our inflation and led us into a very booming 80’s. 

I want to reiterate… I don’t like either side politically, they’re all in bed with the banks. The only reason I’m posting this is because I’m angry at the thought of them getting super leveraged on overpriced stocks and then dumping it on average people. This has so many shades of 2008 it’s not funny. Feel free to argue, bet against me, whatever… I genuinely don’t care. I’ve been a value investor since I was 14 and I’m currently 28. I held through 2020 and 2022, this time feels much much different. 

Whatever you decide to do with this information, be safe out there.

1jfwcij,Lyft to Offer Driverless Ride-Hails ‘as Soon as This Summer’,"(Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc. said it plans to offer driverless vehicles on its platform “as soon as this summer,” and that it sees human drivers transitioning to other work such as fleet management as autonomous rides become more ubiquitous.

The company has been spending more time pitching its vision for the future of its gig-economy business model as it plays catch-up in offering autonomous rides. Driverless ride-hailing has become more commonplace in some key US markets through competing platforms. Like rival Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft envisions a hybrid future where human drivers will complement autonomous vehicle fleets, especially during periods of peak demand.

The autonomous-vehicle economy will create new jobs such as remote vehicle support, fleet management, and map data labeling and validation, said Jeremy Bird, Lyft’s executive vice president in charge of driver experience, said Thursday in a blog post. He also confirmed the driverless service could begin as early as this summer. The company had previously committed to a launch sometime in 2025.

Bird also said the idea of drivers eventually owning autonomous vehicles is core to the company’s strategy, and this will become more feasible as the cost falls for those cars. That would enable drivers to operate small fleets, not unlike how some Airbnb Inc. hosts have made a business out of renting out multiple properties. Elon Musk has a similar vision in which Tesla owners would monetize their vehicles when they aren’t personally using them.

“Even when technology encroaches on human jobs, it doesn’t eliminate the need for humans altogether — especially when workers can provide value that the machines cannot,” Bird wrote. “Humans are features, not bugs, and we’ll continue to find a way to reward those that provide great service as part of a thriving hybrid network.”

Lyft and Uber currently rely on millions of drivers to quickly match with riders. But Lyft, which only operates in the US and Canada, is more exposed to increasing competition from domestic autonomous ride providers such as Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo.

Waymo began offering driverless service more broadly in major markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles last year, and has partnered exclusively with Uber to offer those rides in Austin starting this month. The two companies have a similar agreement to launch driverless trips in Atlanta this summer.

When Lyft launches its first driverless trips, it will be through existing partnerships, including with Toyota Motor Corp.-backed startup May Mobility in Atlanta.

Lyft shares have declined 9% since the start of the year, while Uber’s have gained 23% so far.

Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has gone so far as to predict that human drivers will eventually be displaced as autonomous software develops superior driving skills over the next 15 to 20 years. The company has made some early efforts to help create new earnings opportunities for its network of gig workers, including piloting a Taskrabbit-like service where customers can hire people to complete various household tasks. It’s also recruiting coders and language experts to fuel its new AI data labeling business.

In his blog post, Lyft’s Bird stopped short of predicting when drivers might be displaced, instead saying that driverless cars will create new opportunities for drivers. That includes manual work required to service, maintain and charge the vehicles. These are “jobs for which drivers are well suited,” Bird added.

The industry will also need customer service workers to respond to unusual events during driverless rides. In Lyft’s case, 30% of the staff working in its fleet management unit Flexdrive are former or current Lyft drivers, Bird wrote.

The company has also proposed ways for drivers to find jobs in other industries, offering free training to enter the tech industry. CEO David Risher also recently announced a new feature that uses AI to generate a recommendation letter, which active drivers in good standing can share with potential employers.",2025-03-20 18:50:24,wallstreetbets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-offer-driverless-ride-hails-175137007.html

1jf9qq8,What's TSLA worth in a fire sale?,"Occasionally, I see people suggest TSLA could go to $0. Obviously, any company can go to $0 if it's mismanaged for long enough, so sure, TSLA could go to $0. But some people have explicitly claimed that TSLA is basically a dead man walking, and could go to $0 any day now. This seems wrong, and it's kind of become a pet peeve for me.  
  
But what's the right answer? What's TSLA worth if tomorrow Elon Musk has a psychotic break tomorrow and is filmed running naked through the National Mall, a la the Kony 2012 guy?

Tesla's [most recent annual financial statement](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings) lists a ""stockholder's equity"" also known as book value, of $72.913 billion. Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)

That $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in ""current assets"", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):

>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.

If you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like ""cash"" and ""short-term investments"". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is ""inventory"", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.

Now, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but ""deferred tax assets"" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?

So maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.

I'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.

Even though, yeah, fuck Elon.

Anyway, here's my position, which I'm holding today's movement be damned:

1j9cirg,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,"The S&P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I’m referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I’ve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

1iylpsv,HIDDEN BEHEMOTH V2: NIO,"Hey guys!

Back at it with another DD.  Going to keep it short as many can’t read complete sentences.  Nailed the last few DDs so hopefully I am right again this time.   I only post when I see a big opportunity.

The stock in play is **NIO**, the Chinese Premium EV Brand.  Yes I know, some of you are already thinking, Chinese stocks no thanks but hear me out.     To start, I moved to China for work and own a NIO ES7 and I am a firm believer. 

**Pros:**  

\-          New addressable markets with two new brands.  FIREFLY (low end consumer), On V0 (middle class consumer)  

\-          ON V0 is a game changer because the current model L60 and future models are priced for the mass market.   \*\*They even have access to NIO’s battery swapping stations!!!\*\*  This is huge because right now there is no brand that currently offers battery swapping.   

\-          Battery Swapping technology is what differentiate NIO from their competitors because it takes 5 minutes to change a battery and you are on your way.   They just completed 1 million swaps during the two weeks from Chinese New Year.  The reason why Tesla abandoned the tech is because infrastructure isn’t there/too expensive, but I can tell you it works and it works flawlessly.

\-          Owns/operate the most battery charging stations in China and along highways, the Shanghai charging/swapping operations are about to turn profitable.   Many EV companies use their charging stations as well.

\-          Priced cheaply compared to all other EV Brands, yes because they are not selling as much but be greedy when others are fearful

\-          US politics is a mess right now and in the near future, with DOGE and Trump creating a lot of uncertainties, I believe funds will move back to China as China is very proactive in getting investments back and is actually publicly protecting/enhancing their tech industry instead of beating them down like few yrs ago(check out Chinese equities)

\-          Their CEO mentioned that NIO is seeking to achieve profitability in the last quarter of 2025!!

\-          They will never go bankrupt as it is backed by the government, Tencent, Abu-Dhabi’s CYVN Holdings , so there is essentially zero risk of bankruptcy

**Cons:**

\-          Low sales numbers relative to all other brands but I firmly believe this will change as more people recognize the utility of battery swaps

\-          Lots of competition in Chinese EV market, but if they break through the mass market, there will be a huge upside

\-          They still have very low sales outside China, so it is less vulnerable to tariff compared to other manufacturers, although they are expanding in Europe and have plans for Middle East.

\-          Hemorrhaging cash but they aim to be profitable year end

 

Everything is coming together for this company.   While other Chinese EV stocks went up a lot already like Xpeng and LI.   They are just amazing cars, period.  Don’t look at outdated review from youtube comparing apples to oranges.  They are great cars.  I firmly because the risk/reward for this is amazing.   Losing 30% of your investment for have a potential for few baggers sounds absolutely amazing to me.   It is absolutely no brainer, just look at my last DD for Palantir, I am still holding it and at a 8 bagger as of today.   I put my money where my mouth is.  No options for me because of the high volatility right now.   

Position is 260,000 shares @ 4.63

Sorry for the long post. Good luck everyone!!

1iuykwm,"the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)","A few days ago, I saw the[ \[DD\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.

Today I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.

**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**

Why does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?

The answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.

[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.

Don’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.

Let me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.

**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**

Alright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.

First, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.

You see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.

If there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.

As if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. 

If you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. 

What does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”

I recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”

By way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.

Here is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:

>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

Trump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.

Furthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\*\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\*\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.

**Part III: Positions**

Where to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.

https://preview.redd.it/gtl426m18rke1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46ae72c3552c0d547b0e3c58f81aa77087fdc82

Why did I pick these? (don't mind Humana, Uber, VST)

>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.

>**LYS** is AU but part of ""The Quad"" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes ""(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.""

>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration

>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).

>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)

>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: ""(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.""

>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.

>**TLOFF** is nickel, partnered with TSLA

>**ABAT** is US lithium batteries supply/recycling

>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.

I'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:

>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so""

1iuxffd,Rivian (RIVN) Earnings Review - Bullish,"TLDR: Rivian is a BUY, because it’s cheap  

Post earnings call, Rivian has found gross profit, reducing vehicle production costs by $30k.  

Eyeing the R2 release in a year, they’ve sourced 95% of materials for it at half the cost of R1, seeing growing bargaining power in negotiations while realizing opportunities for production efficiencies.

People are pumped about the R2 release.  

With $7B of cash they are guiding towards a <($2B) loss for 2025 -  

leaving $5B of cash + $3.4B more from VW deal, putting them at a future $8.4B in cash alone for capex and expansion.  

While the DOE loan might see pressure, they will also create **7500 US MANUFACTURING JOBS in Georgia**.  

Killing manufacturing jobs isn’t really aligned with the current admin goals, even as they talk about ICE vehicles and the need to drill more.  

Guidance for ‘25 was conservatively flat given the environment, however -  

With Tesla protests happening and a deep fleet of existing owners, the Tesla to Rivian trade-up is happening in force, which will especially add to R2 demand and existing R1 demand.  

Between R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‘26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  

All of which doesn’t include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.

Rivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.  

Rivian is well capitalized, backed by big players who believe in their position, and most importantly -  

PEOPLE LOVE THEIR PRODUCT.  

In the last year, Rivian is down 15%, while the company position and story becomes better and better.  

Love the trade and upside here!

1iuvlr8,Rivian $6.6B Loan from DOE Will Likely Be Cut,"In January 2025 the DOE scrambled to approve a $6.6B loan to Rivian to expand operations. Rivian has not yet received this money. 

https://www.energy.gov/lpo/project-horizon

That loan is much needed by RIVN. 

They lose roughly $39,000 per vehicle sold currently, have $5.74B in debt and $7.70B in cash. TTM net income is -$4.75B. 

Once Trump took office, he vowed to “look into” the Rivian loan. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fate-rivian-6-6-billion-174558360.html?guccounter=1

Since Elon Musk is making most of these decisions, and he has shown to clearly bias his own businesses thus far with Tesla and SpaceX, it’s likely that they find a way to cancel this loan. 

If the loan gets cancelled, RIVN will sell off.

1irml3j,BlackBerry: A Legacy Stock That’s Going To Get Re-Rated And Run,"BlackBerry is not a dead brand. It’s not a failed smartphone company. It’s not just another stock that spikes when retail traders pile in and then disappears.

It is a deeply entrenched, high-margin infrastructure software business that has gone completely unnoticed in the AI-driven rally. While every software stock remotely connected to AI, IoT, or automation trades at sky-high valuations, BlackBerry—which powers 255M+ vehicles and counting—still trades like a company with no future.

The reality is different. BlackBerry dominates real-time, safety-critical automotive systems with its QNX operating system, and it’s now layering on a SaaS-like business with IVY, a cloud-based vehicle data platform co-developed with AWS.

IVY allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize vehicle sensor data in real time. This is exactly the kind of AI-adjacent, cloud-powered software business that should be trading at 10x revenue, yet the market assigns it zero value.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX is embedded in 255M+ vehicles and continues to expand at 20M+ per year.
* IVY has secured early adopters, including Foxconn’s MIH EV platform, Dongfeng, and Mitsubishi Electric.
* The cybersecurity division, generating $350M–$365M annually, is now stabilized and profitable.

Every other infrastructure software business with this kind of positioning has already been re-rated higher—this one just hasn’t caught up yet.

# The Trade: BlackBerry Gets Re-Rated in the Next 2–3 Quarters—Possibly as Soon as Earnings April 2nd

QNX is growing, IVY is ramping up, and cybersecurity has stabilized, yet the stock price still reflects none of this.

* If BlackBerry provides strong IVY guidance next earnings, the re-rating could start immediately.
* Even without IVY, QNX’s backlog alone justifies a higher multiple.
* Cybersecurity, previously a drag on performance, is now quietly generating cash.

This setup provides a margin of safety with significant upside.

Even if IVY takes time to scale, QNX alone is worth more than what the market is assigning to BlackBerry today.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as an infrastructure software business, it trades at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters. That does not include IVY guidance or it's potential impact on price, which could drive the stock much higher.

# QNX: The Operating System Running Inside 255M+ Vehicles

QNX is not an infotainment OS—it’s the real-time, safety-critical software running inside automotive systems.

* Installed in 255M+ vehicles, growing by 20M+ per year
* $815M backlog (+27% YoY) ensures forward revenue visibility
* Trusted by nearly every major automaker, including BMW, Toyota, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Honda, Stellantis, Bosch, Continental, Magna, and Denso

QNX is embedded in ADAS, digital instrument clusters, telematics, and secure gateways—systems where failure is not an option. Automakers don’t replace this kind of software lightly, which is why QNX enjoys high retention and a long revenue tail.

As vehicles become more software-driven, QNX’s role is only growing.

* Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) require real-time OS solutions that QNX already dominates
* QNX Hypervisor enables multiple systems to run securely on a single chip, increasing its value per vehicle
* EVs and autonomous systems require low-latency, high-reliability computing—exactly what QNX provides

If QNX were valued like a strategic AI-driven infrastructure software provider, it would not be trading at 5x revenue.

A more appropriate 8–10x multiple puts QNX’s valuation at $2.5B–$3.5B alone.

Right now, the market is treating QNX like a legacy asset when it’s actually growing and gaining importance.

# IVY: The Unpriced SaaS Upside That Could Change the Entire Valuation

BlackBerry IVY is a co-developed vehicle data platform with AWS that allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize in-car data.

* Foxconn’s MIH EV platform, Dongfeng Motors, and Mitsubishi Electric have already signed on
* IVY enables software-driven revenue streams for automakers (subscriptions, upgrades, real-time analytics)
* BlackBerry captures recurring revenue from these services

Right now, the market assigns IVY zero value because revenue has not yet scaled.

But automakers are moving toward Tesla-style in-car software features, usage-based pricing, and over-the-air upgrades.

If IVY becomes the data layer that enables this shift, BlackBerry’s valuation moves toward SaaS multiples instead of just embedded software.

And we will know a lot more by next earnings.

# Cybersecurity: No Longer a Drag, Now a Cash Generator

For years, BlackBerry’s cybersecurity business was bloated and uncompetitive.

* Then management sold off Cylance, cut unnecessary costs, and focused on high-trust, high-retention government and enterprise contracts.
* Cybersecurity now generates $350M–$365M annually with a $280M ARR & Margins have improved to 65%
* Trusted by NATO, Fortune 500s, and government agencies

This is not a high-growth business, but it is a stable, profitable enterprise software business that the market is ignoring.

Even at a conservative 2–4x revenue multiple, cybersecurity alone could be worth $700M–$1.2B.

Right now, the market is treating this business as worthless, which makes no sense.

# Market Mispricing: How Big Is the Upside?

BlackBerry is currently trading at \~5x sales, significantly below comparable infrastructure software businesses.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as a legitimate infrastructure software provider, the stock is an easy double from here.

A reasonable valuation based on its components:

* QNX at 8–10x revenue → $2.5B–$3.5B
* Cybersecurity at 2–4x revenue → $700M–$1.2B
* IVY is completely unpriced—if it scales, it could be worth billions

**This pushes BlackBerry’s fair value toward $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters on the low end, $20+ on the high end if IVY scales.**

If IVY guidance is strong next earnings, that re-rating could start immediately.

# Final Thought: The Market Is About to Wake Up

This is not a meme stock revival.

It is an AI-adjacent, embedded infrastructure software business that has somehow escaped the AI stock rally.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX should not be trading like a no-growth legacy product
* IVY is being assigned zero value, despite real partnerships and revenue potential
* Cybersecurity is now a stable asset, not a liability

This stock is one strong IVY earnings guide away from a re-rating to juicy SAAS multiples. BlackBerry is almost certainly about to be priced like a great software company instead of a clown show. When that happens, it’s not trading anywhere near $5.69 anymore.

I’ve put together the above analysis of BlackBerry. I work on these memos for my own personal investments and want to start sharing them. Thought you degens might like them.

I'm going to be posting diligence on reddit regularly, but only on r/wallstreetbets for positions in my personal book. Follow me on directly if you want to read more.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates BlackBerry is a high-margin software business that the market doesn't believe could operate a coffee cart at an airport. Their IOT businesses includes the dominant OS for automotive software and an emerging SaaS platform co-developed with AWS both of which should command high multiples. The stock trades at a massive discount to comparable AI-adjacent infrastructure software businesses. In a base case, the stock should trade at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters and if IOT guidance is strong next earnings it can pop to 20+.",2025-02-17 15:36:20,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1irml3j/blackberry_a_legacy_stock_thats_going_to_get/
1ipmhfx,"Bridgewater is Betting on TSLA, Dumps GS and Buys More MRNA","Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, made a notable shift in its investment strategy late last year, increasing its stake in electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla while exiting positions in major companies like Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology.

According to Bridgewater’s latest 13-F filing, the firm purchased $62 million worth of Tesla shares, representing a 0.28% stake in the company during the fourth quarter of 2024. Tesla stock experienced a post-election rally following the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, largely due to CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with the new administration. By the end of 2024, Tesla’s stock had surged 62%, but 2025 has proven more challenging, with shares already down 12%, amid concerns over slowing sales and Musk’s increasing involvement in other ventures.

Meanwhile, Bridgewater also expanded its position in Moderna, the vaccine manufacturer, acquiring 605,782 shares for a 0.12% stake. At the same time, it completely exited investments in Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology while drastically reducing its holdings in Applied Materials, a semiconductor company. The hedge fund further trimmed its exposure to consumer staples, cutting stakes in CVS Health and Tyson Foods, signaling a strategic shift in its portfolio.

1io2cwt,$INTC The most hated 10 bagger that will make grandma proud,"TLDR; only truly American fab. With AI race at full speed, semiconductor hardware (NOT SOFTWARE) will become the defining strategic resource of the superpowers. 


People will say oh but TSMC is better at production, but NVDA designs better chips, but AMD. We have to take a trip through the history of TSMC and its founder Morris Chang as well as the cold war. 

Let's look at Morris. He went to Harvard and MIT and then stayed in the US to work for Texas Instruments for 30 years, obtaining his American citizenship in the process. 30 years is more time than many in this app have lived thus far. I'd say he's an American through and through. He was next in line for the position of CEO at TI, but ultimately because he was of Chinese descent he was turned down for the role. Now, at the age of 55, the Taiwanese government reached out to him to fund a fab company; TSMC is born. 

AI will be more important than the space race and the nuclear arms race. The implications are so profound that nations are no longer cooperating to build it together and are strategically trying to limit the advancement of their enemies; e.g. blocking Nividia chip sales to China. The most effective embargo is a hardware embargo. 

With national security at stake, if they didn't trust Morris to run TI, what would make them trust TSMC to be the sole provider of chips to America? And on a side note, with TSMC in Taiwan and the vast majority of chips being produced in a country neighboring China, that risk level is over 9000. China is already designing and producing their own  chips with varying degrees of success. You guys can fill in the blank of what the US government fears the most. It is absolutely crucial to have production back in the US. 

That leaves us with the only option, Intel. It is the only company that has a full white lineage of leadership. Real American Company as some would say.

1jyfkuo,TSLA Q2 Deliveries,"Not interestd in long-term debates about viability but, short-term, this has got to be peak uncertainty about the company's future. Q2 delivery consensus has come down a bit but estimates north of 350k still scream 'general TSLA challenges' not refelcting a scenario where Q2 winds up being a complete crisis quarter.

  
Why couldn't Q2 deliveries potentially seize up and wind up coming in < 200k if only for one quarter? 

Q1 typically being weak, seasonality and other historical factors are of little value at this point in time as it seems like there has been a structural shift in the perception of TSLA that isn't going back anytime soon. In fact, so much has happened in such a short period of time that any projections based on YoY trends or growth rates seem antiquated to me. Looking Q1 25 as a baseline - Q2 2025 estimates that reflect an expectation of QoQ growth in units delivered seem aggressive to say the least when broken down regionally:

2025 Q1 Deliveries: 337k:

US 128k

China 79k

EU 63k

RoW approx. 67k with biggest shares from:

Canada 8k

SK/JPN 9k

AU/NZ 6k

Mid East/LATAM combine for 21k

The current 367k Q2 consensus reflects 17% expected YoY decline in deliveries and, holding regional sales mix constant from Q1, implies Q2 expected deliveries:

US 140k

China 86k

EU 69k

RoW 73k

Q1 deliveries were announced Apr 2, the morning of the 'recprocal' rate announcements. The quarter has just begun and the escalations in uncertainty that have taken place only very recently will impact TSLA for all of Q2 most likely. 

I'm having a tought time seeing US deliveries growing by 12k in Q2 vs the first three months of this year considering how quickly the brand has deteriorated...

Above all however, I see the biggest shock risk in the EU and China for Q2 deliveries. 

On Friday we saw TSLA announce a pause on taking orders on certain models in China. That can obviously be rescinded on a whim but, at the same time, can be expanded just as easily too. I think the tit-for-tat risk with China and US tariff escalation may have peaked but headline risk is still high on a day-to-day basis and, given TSLA's proximity to the administration, any new flare ups are likely to hurt TSLA directly. In fact, I would go as far to say China might be inclined to take actions specifically targetting TSLA and Musk if for no other reason than the perceived rift it could cause between Trump and Musk. For China in Q2, can we really say there isn't at least an elevated chance that all new orders and deliveries could be paused at least temporarily? 

At the same time, I cannot fathom how EU Q2 deliveries could show an increase of 6k vs. Q1. I think very soon (gut sense says this month) we will see the EU and China announce a deal on EVs opening up the Euro Zone market for BYD and others.. EU EV market share is already falling off of a cliff with sentiment towards the US and Musk in particular continuing to decline further. I really think a comprehensive EV deal between China and the EU could mark the start of the end of TSLA in Europe. 

Canada might be relatively small overall but Q1 Canadian deliveries were 8.6k - my understanding is a significant majority of those were sold during a particular weekend in January to take advantage of a government EV credit that has since expired. A lot has changed even since January as far as US/Canada relations - does anyone really expect any TSLAs to be delivered in Canada this quarter? 

I could see this being the kitchen sink quarter that gives Musk the cover to step away from DOGE as he's needed back at TSLA FT to oversee the 'robot transition'. Afterall, it's been about a year since he told everyone robo taxis were only a year or so away so it's time to come back and pump everyone up with more fantastical promised. I am bearish on TSLA fundamentals and think event contracts on Q2 deliveries might even be a decent way to hedge shenanigan risk on a stock short.

1jve93c,Repost: It's all about China,"**Mods removed this post yesterday when it had 700 upvotes, probably because it became too political. Reposting in hopes of re-sparking the discussion on this-- obviously with Trump pausing all tariffs except for China and the dip being bought, it looks like what I said would happen happened.**

**However, phase 2 is just beginning.**

DISCLAIMER: I THINK THEIR PLANS ARE 100% DISTILLED ORGANIC REGARDIUM. HOWEVER, THESE PLANS EXIST; IT ISN'T JUST THE DEATH THROES OF A DEMENTED OLD MAN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THEIR GOALS AND HOW THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE THEM, SO YOU DON'T GET WIPED OUT BY A SINGULAR MANIAC'S AMBITIONS.

  
“I believe very strongly in tariffs. America is being ripped off. We’re a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.”

\--Donald Trump, 1988



[Transshipment](https://china.ucsd.edu/_files/02072025-brief-identify-tariff-evasion-web.pdf) is how China bypasses US trade restrictions-- the idea is simple, just ship to an intermediate country in southeast Asia or Mexico before shipping to the United States. Since the entire goal is to evade detection, it's impossible to get direct numbers on how much Chinese originating volume comes into the U.S. in this manner, but it's estimated to be at the very least tens of billions of dollars in goods per year.

This has also been [top-of-mind from Trump's current administration](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/industry-lawmakers-applaud-president-trumps-section-232-tariffs/), with realizations that the 2018 trade war did not go to the extent of their real goals because of ""loopholes"" and negotiation failures. So, this time around, the goal is the same-- a trade war with China, but the entire world has become collateral damage.

Their goals behind the trade war with China hasn't drastically changed from 2018:

* [Coward Nutlick has repeatedly hinted that ""deindustrialization is a national security risk"".](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick-on-face-the-nation-with-margaret-brennan-april-6-2025/) In layman's terms, if a war ever broke out, [China would be able to pump out missiles and weapons at a faster pace.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA787225532&sid=sitemap&v=2.1&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7E3a357c28&aty=open-web-entry) Peter Navarro has said that ""every time you buy a good made in China, you are financing their navy in the Taiwan strait."" His book Death by China (2011) also details how we are dependent on their supply chains for medical supplies, electronics, and weapons.
* Miran, senior economic advisor to Trump: [trade deficits are economic dependence.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-hudson-institute-event-remarks/) True at face value, but the dependency goes both ways. As with the fundamental theory of trading and competitive advantage goes, both sides win. U.S. industry is built off the back of Chinese supply and labor, and the Chinese have become wealthy off of the largest consumer market in the world.

So, the plan that would somewhat explain their intentions behind tariffing the world is to get other countries to come to the table, fence-off Chinese transshipping, and/or strike deals that cut off Chinese suppliers to third party countries as well. This would explain why they imposed tariffs on penguin-inhabited islands such as [Heard and McDonald Island](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/revealed-how-trump-tariffs-slugged-norfolk-island-and-uninhabited-heard-and-mcdonald-islands)\-- closing off loopholes. They want to hurt China while hurting ourselves, but think that we can withstand the pain more than they can. It's unclear as to whether they're right, or if this game is even worth playing, but it's definitely *a plan, even if it's a bad one,* which is better for the market than having no narrative or confidence.

What does this mean in the short term? Trump has no intention to keep unjustifiably high tariffs on everyone else *besides China.* As deals are struck, either side capitulates, it becomes clear that ""liberation day"" was just a second attempt at 2018 U.S. vs. China, which, to investors, is at least preferable to U.S. vs. The World (for seemingly no reason). With a narrative to cling onto and a return to (relative) normalcy, the markets can go up in the short term because of a universal instinct to ""buy the dip."" The markets no longer have reason to freefall panic that a literal maniac is driving the world economy to ruin; he at least has a plan, if not a half-baked one.

**""THE MARKETS CAN GO UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A UNIVERSAL INSTINCT TO BUY THE DIP"" --me**

**""TO INVESTORS, U.S. VS. CHINA IS PREFERABLE TO U.S. VS. THE WORLD"" --me**

However, as the initial panic subsides, the ramifications of ""reducing the trade deficit with China"" will set in. Numbers like earnings, inflation, consumer spending, and GDP growth will bleed. Eventually unemployment, defaults, and bankruptcies will follow, putting the Fed in an unwinnable situation. The private sector won't want to build US factories, find alternative trading partners (who will take the opportunity to increase prices), and ""reindustrialize"" because the Republicans could simply lose in a few years, and the policy is reversed. Imagine spending billions in U.S., factories paying 5x in wages, only for these cheap overseas pathways to open up again. There needs to be private sector *confidence* that these policies are set in stone, which is why Trump has continually attempted to affirm that they are. But they aren't. Cost-push inflation is going to rile the peasants in the U.S. once again to chop off the heads of the incumbents, and Republicans are projected to lose bigly in 2026 and 2028.

tl;dr: Since the goal is to ""Reduce the trade deficit with China,"" this will directly eat into profit margins of U.S. companies and the spending power of the working class, at a failed attempt to reindustrialize America. China may be hurt as well; but in this future, it may be at a cost of a popping AI bubble and a new U.S. depression.

**UPDATE AFTER TRUMP HAS PAUSED ALL TARIFFS EXCEPT FOR CHINA**

I think this is a bit of corroboration to my original theory that global tariffs was an attempt to strong-arm the rest of the world into U.S.'s side against China. If you were to get my opinion on whether this was the most intelligent or reasonable way to do it, I obviously have an endless amount of things to say. But my opinion doesn't matter; this post is simply trying to discern their ambitions, and how they will try to achieve them. Understanding the incentives behind this chaos is of supreme importance to best navigate it.

Who are these people that Trump has surrounded himself with? Navarro, Miran, Lighthizer, Kudlow, Barr, Bannon, Mnuchin, Rubio, Waltz, Helberg, Bolton, Pottinger, Wray...

Navarro refused to comply with a Jan. 6 subpoena, in 2023 was sentenced to 4 months in prison. He also promoted Lab Leak conspiracies and has had a long history of questionable policy advocacy, solely focused on how China is ""ripping off the world."" Trump's rhetoric on China, trade deficits, and tariffs is almost ripped straight from Navarro's various books. Lighthizer and Miran have long advocated for using high tariffs as a coercive weapon, and have had histories of downplaying the effects of retaliation on domestic industries. Some of these anti-China allies are truly focused on national security with legitimate concerns over IP theft and Chinese rapid militarization.

Are these people the originators of Trump's ideology, or did Trump select the fringe, controversial figures in economics and defense that corroborated with his worldview? It's unclear, but no matter how this unified political stance came to be, the conclusion is simple:

**Trump's administration believes that national security vs. China is the critical goal that potentially supercedes the Stock Market, domestic industrial stability, inflation, and the buying power of the average American. They are willing to destroy access to Chinese supply chains to force America to ""decouple"" with China.** **They don't care about Apple, Tesla, the S&P 500, etc; for one, Trump thinks that the Fed will eventually do ZIRP and infinite QE to pump the stocks once more, and that slashing 50% off of Apple is worth it as long as they find other suppliers or build domestic supply chains.**

**He believes in ""short term pain,"" however, in a year or a few years, U.S. capital dominance will survive, after purging the ""dependency"" on China.**

Simply put:

AAPL, TSLA, WMT, NKE, BBY, QCOM, INTC 2026 PUTS.

However, in the short term, stocks will continue to pump as the ""apocalypse cancelled; buy the dip"" reflex continues over the rest of the week.

1jv0l7a,It looks like somebody saved Musk from a margin call in 2022,"Let's reiew some details around Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter. On April 14th, 2020, Musk announced he wanted to buy Twitter. Initially, Twitter resisted the proposal. Six days after the initial announcement (April 20th), Musk announced he'd secured funding for the deal, funding which, according to a [commitment letter from Morgan Stanley](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922049844/tm2213189d8_ex99-i.htm), included a $12.5 billion margin loan against Musk's TSLA stock. Then, on April 25th, Twitter dropped its opposition to the proposal and accepted Musk's offer.

But the $12.5 billion margin loan never happened. And I find the timeline of how it didn't happen very interesting. On May 4th, Musk announced [revised financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922056055/tm2214608-1_sc13da.htm) which cut the margin loan to $6.25 billion. Then on May 13th Musk announced was the deal ""on hold"", before two hours later saying he was ""Still committed to acquisition"". But this left people wondering what the hell Musk was doing. Then on May 24th Musk announced [new financing terms](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922064655/tm2216931d1_sc13da.htm) with no margin loan. At the time, financial columnist Matt Levine [interpreted this as proof](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-26/elon-called-off-his-margin-loan) that Musk was just kidding about the deal being ""on hold"". After all, it's not like putting a deal that's already been signed ""on hold"" is a thing in the M&A world anyway.

Except then in July, Musk's lawyers sent Twitter a letter, [made public in an SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm), saying they really were terminating the deal based on alleged breach of contract on Twitter's part. Twitter sued, and Musk looked ready to fight, before finally going ahead with the acquisition in October.

It's a good thing (for Musk, anyway) that the margin loan never happened. According to the commitment letter, the $12.5 billion loan would've been against $62.5 billion in TSLA stock, and would be subject to a margin call if the loan value ever exceeded 35% of the value of the collateral. Furthermore, on January 3rd of the following year, TSLA closed below $325/share, and almost fell below $305/share three days later before recovering. (TSLA has since undergone a 3:1 stock split, so if you're comparing to the current price, think of this as almost hitting $100/share.) Under the original financing plan for the Twitter deal, this almost certainly would have result in a margin call, since in the entire month of October, when the deal closed, the stock had never fallen below $600/share (or $200/share in split-adjusted terms).

Then, in a coda almost nobody noticed, Tesla released the [proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312523094075/d451342ddef14a.htm) for its 2023 shareholder meeting, which included a section on ""Board Responsiveness"", which stated, ""We have received, and continue to periodically receive, helpful input regarding a number of stockholder-related matters... As a result, we have adopted a number of significant changes, including but not limited to... Amending our pledging policy to... cap the aggregate loan or investment amount that can be collateralized by the pledged stock of our CEO to the lesser of $3.5 billion or twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock"". No such policy was mentioned in the [2022 proxy statement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459022022992/tsla-pre14a_20220804.htm), obviously—it would've made the original proposal to acquire Twitter with a $12.5 billion margin loan impossible.

Taken together, all of this makes me think that *somebody* freaked out when Musk announced his original plan to finance the Twitter acquisition, and basically told him, ""what the fuck? No, you can't do that"". When billionaires get margin called, it can absolutely tank the stock price, which is probably why the commitment letter set such a relatively low threshold (35%) for triggering a margin call.

I think what happened in May 2022 is Musk initially tried to placate whoever was telling him ""fuck no"" by cutting the size of the loan in half, and when they weren't placated he tried to back out fo the deal, because he made the offer when he thought he could do the deal entirely with borrowed money and got cold feet when faced with the prospect of actually having to sell, rather than just borrow against, his TSLA stock to get the deal done. But in telling Musk ""fuck no"", whoever it was **saved Musk from himself and a margin call**.

It doesn't really matter who the ""somebody"" was, though I can't help but wonder if it was Tesla's largest shareholder—Vanguard. While known mainly for pioneering index funds, not noisy activist investing, and while I have never heard of them *starting* a proxy fight, Vanguard 100% *will* side with activist investors in proxy fights if they feel it's warranted. And they much more frequently ""engage"" with companies, and when your largest shareholder engages with you, you take it seriously, even when the engagement is phrased as polite suggestions. So I wonder if all the will-he-or-won't-he drama about acquiring Twitter in 2022 was because Vanguard wasn't happy with Musk's original plan.

Anyway, none of this means a Musk margin call is *impossible*, but I suspect it could only happen if Tesla was publicly known to be at risk of bankruptcy. I company is in serious trouble, but if you're betting against it (as I am), don't suddenly start getting careless if, say, the stock price drops to $120/share and there's a rumor going around further drops are a sure bet because Musk is getting margin called.

1jthv06,watching for snapback setups off gap down open with historical reference and setup potential,"if open is lower than what we are all expecting, would focus on watching for short term reversal setups in a few oversold names. not necessarily entering into anything early but waiting for key levels to come into and watch for signs of exhaustion based on historical context in previous flushes discussed under, extreme pressure tends to revert when it gets stretched too far intraday.

so as for the historical context framework, after the 1987 crash the dow recovered about 57 percent in the two sessions that followed the bottom. same thing happened after the 2008 october flush and again in march 2020. 

the context shifts but the structure tends to repeat. liquidity dries up, forced selling takes over, and once that flow slows down you often get sharp intraday reversals even in weak broader trends. 
in 87 the crash accelerated because of dynamic hedging strategies that sold more as prices dropped, creating a feedback loop that hit futures first and then cash markets. books got overwhelmed, bids vanished, and once that flow exhausted the bounce came fast. 

in 08 it was margin pressure and credit risk. banks had to unwind whatever was liquid and those with tighter funding positions, pretty much made the selling spiral worse until coordinated policy stepped in. 
same thing again in 2020 where no one knew what earnings or demand would look like so everything risk got dumped. volatility went to the moon and alot sectors started moving in sync, and depth disappeared until liquidity support came in and flipped the tape. 

now the potential ‘black monday’ we face shouldn’t be a repeat of 87 imo, but some of the same stress points are showing up. risk is extended, volatility is climbing, liquidity’s thinning out, and this recent price action looks like the front end of a liquidation cycle. if we gap down hard and that volume keeps pushing into weak books, the key is watching when that forced flow dries up. that’s usually when things snap back fast intraday and structure starts to reset. nothing guaranteed but it’s a pattern that’s repeated across every major dislocation. 

recent positions similar to this framework include tsla calls on pre march 20th setups in hood, reddit and more. all of them opened heavy and reversed clean once selling pressure faded. setups were mostly based on volume spikes near prior levels and reclaiming vwap after early weakness. this kind of move matches intraday reversal probability especially when it comes from liquidity holes followed by clear buying into strength

still holding a bearish lean overall into 26’ and early 27’. positioned with spy 2026 puts and exposure in cvna and arkk. already explained the reasoning in previous posts in the sub.

I didn't get to post my DD with my YOLO because I failed a ban bet. Also I forgot to put it in the post.

Last week’s gold event: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab\_channel=Robinhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab_channel=Robinhood)

TLDR: IMO Robinhood is the best stock on the market right now with a great business model and the best team and has the most upside potential, even during a market downturn.

They had 1.5 million gold subscribers at $5/month last year. Now MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 3.2 MILLION.

Robinhood has the potential to become the next trillion-dollar company. Everyone is always looking for the next stock that will have NVDA or TSLA-like growth and I have good reason to believe that Robinhood is the one. Literally a 30-bagger since they’re at $37 billion, which is NOTHING. For example, about $1 trillion flew out of Nvidia in like a month and Robinhood only needs around $55 billion more to reach $100/share. They actually have a good business model leading the great leap forward in transforming finance with a CEO that is already mainstream. Man is on CNBC last week: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision)

They are going to smash earnings again IMO. Been taking money hand over fist. They already smashed earnings last quarter.

I’d say that inclusion into the S&P 500 is on the horizon. They just missed it last quarter but I see no reason why they can’t be in this quarter with a lot of stocks tanking. And we all know what happened when TSLA was put into the S&P 500 with a similarly well-known CEO known as the Elongated Muskrat. ROCKET EMOJI.

Robinhood is overhauling everything with their services, including the use of AI. That’s right. The AI buzzword. They cap their fees at $250/year for investment advisor systems.

Cash delivery? Bruh I’m never going to an ATM again: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

They have 12 partner banks so FDIC insurance is $2.5 million with them instead of $250,000: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/)

Robinhood is now VENMO/Apple Pay. You can send money to people instantly: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

Robinhood makes money on everything. Options, crypto, and now even straight-up gambling with prediction markets. Even in a terrible market they still make money on fees and subscriptions.

I don't really care about any litigation involving prediction markets and I don't think anyone else does either. Gambling always wins.

Cathie Wood bought like $25 million recently (Now holds 5% of ARKK’s holdings, TSLA is 11% for reference) and it was given a price target of $105 last week: [https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578)

IRA contribution and 401k transfer match is literally a money magnet.

People will live their entire financial lives through Robinhood. They have high-yield interest rates on uninvested cash and have a debit card. Kind of like how people use WeChat for everything.

They also have a credit card with 3% cash back on EVERYTHING (best on the market from what I’ve seen) = more money.

Great Wealth Transfer putting trillions of dollars in Millennials and Gen Z hands, going straight to RH for gambling, and especially on this sub.

Robinhood is honestly like a 7x leveraged SPY imo. Every time SPY is up 1% Robinhood is up 7%, and vice versa with the same chart pattern. SPY really only needs to go to 570 for HOOD to go to $50 from $42. $50 by the end of the week bc we will get the clarity from the big dude tomorrow.

Easy to use platform.

I am also predicting we have a face-ripping rally on liberation day because no one gives a fuck about tariffs. This is all about selling the rumor and buying the news so we all have certainty. JPOW also speaks Friday so my boy is going to pump it up.

1jjt9qf,Stop buying $TSLA puts,"Hello Regard,

I have consistently been buying $TSLA puts every time it pumps and made decent money but guys, this time it's different. A 13% pump simply due to ""softer tariffs"" makes no sense. $NVDA and the SPY have not been moving like $TSLA this past week. Again, a sudden pump to +4% just before closing is very sus. They are somehow managing to trap the retail virgin. How can a stock skyrocket 13% literally after they announce that they lost 44% sales in Europe? When $INTC reported an 8b loss, it lost 30% valuation in 30 minutes. Intuitive Machine($LUNR) lost 50% valuation because they didn't land something on the moon, idk.

At 3:05PM I noticed a 12M BUY Volume on $TSLA on my Robinhood App. The same thing happened yesterday on closing, someone bought 2M stock. This is not retail investor, This is Elmo and 🥭 cooking up some massive scam which is going to completely cook the retail investor and us, WSB Put buyers. I have made good money buying $TSLA puts but today I have made the cumulative decision to stay away from them.

1jiqjas,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE), [VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK), [BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV), [9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK), [GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.",2025-03-24 13:22:21,wallstreetbets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-bmw-group-electric-cars-114132432.html

1jhdnw2,Modified Discounted Cash Flow for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI),"Since my[ last post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hgflri/i_let_chatgpt_author_a_financial_model_human/)about TSLA predicted a market correction for the stock (as we are currently seeing as of March 2025), I am back with a different speculation idea for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI). **I have basically modified the framework of discounted cash flow (DCF) to function in terms of industry multiples.**

Instead of discounting each period's cash flow and adding them up, I decided to discount the net income in each period (using SoFi's cost of equity estimate) instead and then multiply that by the mean P/E ratio estimate for the finance industry, essentially deriving the stock price in today's value for each period of earnings. Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.

**Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No**, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.

**My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead.** Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.

Lastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.

1jf9qq8,What's TSLA worth in a fire sale?,"Occasionally, I see people suggest TSLA could go to $0. Obviously, any company can go to $0 if it's mismanaged for long enough, so sure, TSLA could go to $0. But some people have explicitly claimed that TSLA is basically a dead man walking, and could go to $0 any day now. This seems wrong, and it's kind of become a pet peeve for me.  
  
But what's the right answer? What's TSLA worth if tomorrow Elon Musk has a psychotic break tomorrow and is filmed running naked through the National Mall, a la the Kony 2012 guy?

Tesla's [most recent annual financial statement](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings) lists a ""stockholder's equity"" also known as book value, of $72.913 billion. Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)

That $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in ""current assets"", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):

>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.

If you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like ""cash"" and ""short-term investments"". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is ""inventory"", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.

Now, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but ""deferred tax assets"" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?

So maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.

I'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.

1jywt29,Whats the bull case and how does it address the current bear arguments ?,"Hey,

So I'm fan of robots right and FSD so I see alot of potential there, but we know elon has been taking years of delay to deliver so if they deliver this year something great, otherwise ouch. 

Most of tesla value is fsd and robots, but how do you look at the sales declines ? And why that happened, and how big of a deal is it. What's your take? There's common argument from bulls about the model Y refresh which is true but it's not a 100% answer for everything, I wanna dig deeper.

Are more of a bull / bear atm and whats ling term position ?

I'm a bull or was, and I still see potential but definitely at a point where I'm reconsidering all factors, with all the shit that's been going on. So I'm at a crossroad considering all factors again, reconsidering  whether I still see the fsd / robots making it, like in short I believe they will do it for sure, but question is when.. and at what scale ? And whether that's enough to pump it when something comes out. And what potential impact might competitiok have, what sort of market share could tesla end up with in each of these sectors.

If you have anything / any point to make please share it, but I ask for seriousness, like no troll just genuine opinions and reasoning is appreciated. Please enlighten me with your take

1jozzx2,Musk’s Politics Don’t Define Tesla’s Value,"While I agree that Musk's actions in DC are reckless and inappropriate, we should not equate stock price to company value, now or when it was well over $400/share a few months ago. December's and today's prices represent emotions, not any rational evaluation. Similarly, short-term market reactions do not indicate long-term company value. Some other thoughts investors should keep in mind:

* TSLA is still the most significant upside/risk of any single stock I can find.
   * Tesla's long-term value to investors and the world has almost nothing to do with selling cars to consumers.
   * Despite that, Teslas are:
      * the safest and cleanest vehicles in the world, both in production and use
      * outstanding in comfort and performance
      * more affordable than other cars in their class, and many lower
      * have the highest margins of any mass producer
   * That results in the most profit and the greatest good of any comparable product. Yet, all that profit is just boot-strap funds for the arbitrarily greater good and profit to come in the next few years.
   * Tesla delivers all this while taking better care of their employees, especially factory workers, than the rest of the industry, including union shops.
* Tesla still stands out as the most moral and ethical major car maker, even accounting for Musk's recent politics.
   * You must look beyond the headlines and FUD stories of the last two decades to understand this, because the rest of them pay:
      * the advertising/protection money that keeps their evil acts out of the spotlight
      * the lobbyists/political money that keeps the governments off their backs
   * All that protection money also puts a negative spin on everything around Tesla because Tesla is their biggest threat.
   * When you do that research, especially if you include connections with fossil fuels, there is little left to subjectivity.
* Even beyond all his astounding technical and business accomplishments, Musk's greatest miracle is convincing the wing-nuts on the right to become interested in electric cars, and next, sustainability in general.
   * Tesla and Musk are mission-driven: accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
   * Placating wing-nuts on the left who claim to be on board already does nothing to accelerate, while convincing 1/4 of those who are politically resistant is a monumental effect.
   * Look at the search trends for ""buy Tesla"" if you need a visualization.
   * The middle of the herd always follows the rest.

Ultimately, Musk is not responsible for being allowed to do things the way he has always done. Only the President can force a change in that regard, and only Congress can legally force a change in the presidency. This level of access for DOGE and Musk is a symptom of a broken political duopoly and the forces perpetuating it from behind the scenes.

In any case, these emotions should not dictate our investment decisions. They should make us reevaluate as the world continues to change, but we should not react to the whims of the media lest we be controlled by those we should resist the most.

Displacing our resistance on Tesla is ineffective and is just the kind of distraction they want.",2025-04-01 16:31:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jozzx2/musks_politics_dont_define_teslas_value/
1joqcpy,Tesla down 64% YoY in Sweden (march),"Ai translated article below. I also included original article.


In March, 24,204 new passenger cars were registered in Sweden, according to new figures from the industry organization Mobility Sweden. This is an increase of 1.3 percent from the same month last year, but the market is still described as weak as new registrations are 23 percent below the month's average over the past five years.
In the first three months of the year, 63,444 cars have been registered in Sweden, which is an increase of 6 percent from last year.
Sales of Tesla cars have plummeted at the beginning of the year, and in March the decline accelerated. During the month, 911 cars of the brand were registered, which was a decrease of 64 percent from the same month last year. In the first three months of the year, Tesla registrations have decreased by 55 percent.
The decline has previously been explained by the fact that the best-seller Model Y is to come in an updated version, which has affected deliveries. Customers have also testified that they have distanced themselves from Tesla after the company's CEO Elon Musk became the American president Donald Trump's close ally.


I mars registrerades 24.204 nya personbilar i Sverige, visar nya siffror från branschorganisationen Mobility Sweden. Det är en ökning med 1,3 procent från samma månad förra året, men marknaden beskrivs ändå som svag då nyregistreringarna ligger 23 procent under månadens snitt de senaste fem åren.

Under årets tre första månader har 63.444 bilar registrerats i Sverige, vilket är en en ökning med 6 procent från fjolåret. 

Försäljningen av bilar från Tesla￼ har rasat i början av året och i mars accelererade nedgången. Under månaden registrerades 911 bilar av märket vilket var en nedgång med 64 procent från samma månad i fjol. Under årets tre första månader har Teslaregistreringarna minskat med 55 procent.

Nedgången har tidigare förklarats av att bästsäljaren Model Y ska komma i en uppdaterad version, vilket har påverkat leveranserna.

The U.S. Justice Department said 36-year-old Paul Hyon Kim made an initial appearance Thursday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, where he is facing one count of unlawful possession of an unregistered firearm and one count of arson. He remains in federal custody.

Earlier this week, Kim was booked into the Clark County jail and initially charged with 15 counts by local authorities, including suspicion of arson, destroying personal property of another valuing $5,000 or more, possessing/disposing of a fire device and discharging a firearm into vehicle, according to jail records.

In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi called the recent string of arsons and vandalism targeting Teslas a ""wave of domestic terrorism,"" and said perpetrators will face severe consequences.

“We will continue to find, arrest, and prosecute these attackers until the lesson is learned,"" Bondi said in the statement.

If convicted in federal court, Kim faces a maximum penalty of 10 years on the firearm charge and a maximum of 20 years on the arson charge, according to the Justice Department.",2025-03-28 04:33:20,teslainvestorsclub,https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-arrested-after-setting-teslas-fire-las-vegas/story?id=120220369

1jk4fxn,FT row back it's claim about 1.4bn missing.,"  
[https://www.ft.com/content/d2711678-af23-4b71-852b-1ef2e932e14b](https://www.ft.com/content/d2711678-af23-4b71-852b-1ef2e932e14b)  
  
Mea culpa. Having last week got rather excited by the minutiae of Tesla’s accounting, its time to row back on the apparent $1.4bn gap between capital investment and asset values.

The question of why a cash-rich company raised new debt in both of the last two years still stands, as does the trajectory of that cash balance if car sales continue to crater. But Tesla’s balance-sheet mismatch may have a benign explanation.

Lessons below, including kind words from one of the expert correspondents who got in touch to say that “reconciling accrual-based accounts with cash accounts (especially with the cash flow statement in its indirect form) is always difficult.” Indeed.

At issue was the difference between Tesla’s $6.3bn of capital investment in the second half of last year, and the smaller $4.9bn rise in the value of the gross assets it reported.

Two things help to reconcile the numbers: payments for assets already purchased, and the possible disposal of depreciated property.

The first is found at the bottom of the cash flow statement, where Tesla notes a balance sheet detail:

>

The line, explained in moderately simple terms [here](https://www.415group.com/blog/dealing-with-common-statement-of-cash-flows-issues), represents the balance of property plant and equipment purchased on credit. During the six months in question, Tesla paid down $689mn of those liabilities, shrinking the apparent gap to $733mn.

Asset disposals reduce the gap by another $270mn, to $463mn. While Tesla didn’t disclose any material asset sales or impairments, its capital investment figure is reported on a net basis. Comparing the depreciation expense with the change in accumulated depreciation indicates that assets depreciated by $270mn were disposed of.

The crack we’re left with at Tesla is now small enough — just under half a billion dollars — to be filled with some combination of foreign exchange movements, non-material asset write-offs, or the sale of machinery or equipment close to its not-fully depreciated value.

US investors may be interested to learn that under international accounting standards, no-such sleuthing is required because a reconciliation of these factors is published. For instance, here’s VW:

As we sound the Alphaville bugle while lowering this particular red flag, one unavoidable conclusion is that at a certain point it’s necessary to trust the auditor’s judgment.

Working capital movements are such an example. Last year, changes in “accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities” contributed $3.6bn to Tesla’s operating cash flow.

The line suggests that even though Tesla sales shrank last year, it improved its cash position in part by taking longer to pay suppliers.

Like other large listed companies, the link to the balance sheet figures is not immediately apparent. The total for “accounts payable” plus “accrued liabilities and other” fell by $300mn, to $23.5bn, which might suggest a small cash outflow overall. There was also a $2bn rise in long-term other liabilities, which are mainly composed of lease liabilities and warranty commitments.

The likely explanation, our new accountant friends tell us, is in the allocation of flows to the operations, investing or financing parts of the cash flow statement, which would require insider knowledge or documentation to reconcile.

If Tesla, which does not often respond to media requests, does come back with comments we’ll update this post.

In the meantime, those fascinated by accounting minutiae still have plenty to hold their interest, as Tesla invests heavily in AI infrastructure and has almost $7bn worth of assets under construction. Cash generation and debt issuance remain areas of interest.

But with Tesla very nearly recovered to a fully diluted $1tn stock market valuation, what really matters to investors may present the bigger question.",2025-03-26 05:17:26,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jk4fxn/ft_row_back_its_claim_about_14bn_missing/

1jfmv7f,Call it what it is,"A family member recently purchased a model Y and she loves the car. However, now she is scared to drive it. She is older and watches the news so its peddled into her head that she may get shot or attacked by the mainstream liberals.

This is not just on reddit, multiple charging stations and dealerships are literally being shot up, blown up or firebombed. These are real actions people are taking and this isn't just reddit being reddit.

Don't make any mistake, this is 100% mainstream liberals/leftists, in:

The mainstream political class - See Tim Walz, VP candidate - rooting for the downfall of the 7th largest american company, no congress person on the left has disavowed this violence while others actively calling for it.
The mainstream leftist media, actively calls for violence and defends these people on a routine basis. MSNBC, CNN, AP, etc. All of them are culpable.
The mainstream leftist class - regular people keying cars, violent protests, acts of violence torwards tesla and tesla owners.
The online community - heavy supporters of violence and terrorism, chearing it on and inciting/calling for violence - doxing people, rewarding this behavior etc.
Their purpose is exactly what my family member is feeling - instilling terror on normal citizens to drive a piece of their own property around town. They want you to feel unsafe because you made a choice on what car to buy. This is their goal, make no mistake.

Fight back.

If you see someone perpertrating violence, video them, report them to the police and defend yourself and your property. I'm pleased to see that the admin is treating this as serious as they are. If you see a video of someone doing this, share it on social media, show it to your friends.

We must handle this as a community and fight back against legitamite terrorism. If you remain on the left, call your congress person and ask them to speak out against this.

Your grandma, daughter, mom, dad whoever, should not feel afraid in daily life because the left glorifies violence against citizens because they don't like Elon. It is abhorent behavior and I can't believe its gotten to this point.

The only way to deal with terrorism is to face it down and let the law do its job. Be careful, don't use violence, but make sure you are doing your part to ensure your family and friends feel safe. I wish this wasn't a mainstream leftist priority but it is.

Don't be scared, fight back and ensure this behavior is flipped on its head where people who think about instilling terrorism on normal people because of their car choice, get the full force of the law and they are the ones to be afraid.",2025-03-20 11:38:53,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jfmv7f/call_it_what_it_is/

1jedjdk,Why does no one talk about Tesla P/E?,"Long time Tesla bull (90% of my net worth and have been invested since 2015). But if you look at the trailing twelve month earnings per share or even the optimistic forward earnings per share in 2025, assuming no recession and car sales hold up (need to keep unemployment at this historical low that it is), Tesla PE will still be >100. This is extremely high for a top 10 company in the SP500. 

I think EPS for 2025 is reported to be between $2.55 and $3.30/share. If you even assume a 50x forward PE on that high end, that’s only $165/share and still trading at a premium. 

I truly believe Tesla will solve general autonomy for vehicles, and they’re clearly in the lead with an actual scalable approach, but I also believe at least some part of FSD is de facto valued in to the stock otherwise it wouldn’t trade at these multiples.. because revenue is not growing and profits are not growing. So what other justification is there? 

Long term I like the current valuation where it is, if you’re going to hold 5+ years. But you have to realize that FSD is somewhat baked in right? Or what am I missing that’s causing the large premium?",2025-03-18 19:28:21,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jedjdk/why_does_no_one_talk_about_tesla_pe/
1jeb4l9,"The same survey that showed 94% Germany won't buy Tesla, now shows 70% will buy Tesla","Tesla is NOT done in Germany–exact same poll debunks its own “94% won’t buy Tesla” narrative

As of writing, 307,119 readers, or 69.9% of the study’s overall respondents, stated that they would still buy a Tesla.

As it turns out, news of Tesla’s demand death in Germany have been widely exaggerated. This is highlighted by the same poll that was used to frame the narrative that 94% of car buyers will not buy a Tesla in Germany.

So no, Tesla is not done in Germany. Nowhere close.

The Survey and the Reports
A look at the Tesla news cycle over the past few days would show that one of the biggest stories about the electric vehicle maker involved the results of a survey from German publication t-online. As per the reports, a survey of over 100,000 t-online readers has shown that 94% were not willing to buy a Tesla, and only a minuscule 3% were still willing to consider a vehicle from the American EV maker. 

t-online’s report on its survey, as well as articles that cited the study, related the alleged drop in Tesla interest in Germany to Elon Musk’s conservative politics. However, the survey itself received polarizing reactions among social media users since its respondents were self-selected. The poll also seemed open to everyone globally, so its results may not have been the most accurate.

These concerns, of course, were largely ignored and dismissed as the complaints of Tesla “cult” members or “stans,” as critics stated on social media. Unfortunately for Elon Musk/Tesla critics, it appears that t-online‘s Tesla poll is not done telling its story just yet.

Ongoing Survey, Drastically Different Results
While t-online published its article about Tesla’s alleged decline in Germany after the study passed 100,000 responses, the survey itself was actually left open. Thus, despite articles stating that Tesla is done in Germany already spreading online, t-online’s survey was still gathering data from respondents. Interestingly enough, the survey started showing a drastically different narrative once it started getting more respondents.

As of writing, a total of 439,111 respondents have participated in t-online’s Tesla survey. As of writing, 307,119 readers, or 69.9% of the study’s overall respondents, stated that they would still buy a Tesla. A total of 128,643 readers, or 29.3% of the study’s respondents, stated that they would “absolutely no way” consider a Tesla. A total of 3,296 t-online readers, or 0.8% of the survey’s current respondents, stated that they “do not know” if they would like to buy a Tesla.

Keeping Things in Perspective
While one could argue that the current findings of the survey are probably astroturfed by Tesla “stans” or “cult” members, the fact remains that the poll itself was flawed to begin with. Its self-selected respondents could have been affected by bias, and the fact that it seemed open to all users across the globe suggests that the study may not have accurately represented Germany’s car buying public at all.

With this in mind, it would be unreasonable to argue that t-online‘s poll was completely accurate up to its first 100,000 respondents but inaccurate when more respondents answered the survey. The reports that emerged from the first 100,000 respondents of the poll concluded that Tesla was finished in Germany. Following the same logic, one could argue that such reports were premature, and based on updated data from the same survey, Tesla still enjoys majority support in Germany.

1jdimnd,Why I decided to “panic first.”,"As the saying goes, there are two rules for long-term investing: 1) Don’t panic. 2) Panic first. 

I practiced rule number one for a long time. A little over a month ago, I finally decided to practice rule number two.

I was long for over 8 years. My cost basis was about $24 a share. I got completely out from Feb. 2-10. (One batch at $382.245/share and the second at $354.575/share.)

Obviously, my returns were fantastic, and I’m very happy with them. Tesla is now discounted over $115 from where I sold it, and I currently see no reason to jump back in.

I also owned 2 Teslas, one of which I recently sold, the other which will be sold soon. (They were both over 6 years old.) They were the 2 best cars I ever owned.

Unfortunately, Elon has proved a lot of the old-school Tesla haters right on a number of points and has brought what were before easily dismissed background, obscure quirks of an eccentric founder to the foreground of public opinion around the world. He has graduated from eccentric and quirky to erratic and unhinged. He is ignoring his responsibilities of the day-to-day operation of Tesla and actively working on supporting or even implementing government policy that will be or is already harmful to Tesla and its shareholders.

The stock is now not only untethered from reality (in a bullish way) by the arguably irrational exuberance of Elon’s bold vision, it’s now under mainstream attack for purely political reasons by huge swaths of the people who should be aligned with the company’s stated vision and should be buying what Tesla is selling and plans to sell in the future. The fundamentals do not support the valuation and have not for a very long time. The price is very much predicated on excellent execution of numerous key product roadmaps. Whether or not Tesla is able to effectively execute on delivering the AI, FSD/robotaxi, robotics, energy, and automotive roadmaps, there are very real concerns with their ability to overcome the brand damage Elon has caused and continues to cause. 

Whether or not you agree with the backlash, it is real and is proving to have material impact on sales and on the stock and on the brand value of the company.

I really used to believe in Elon. Unless and until I see the old genius Elon return to lead the company, or his influence is materially diminished to the point where he can no longer cause harm, I’m reluctant to reinvest. 

Whether it’s drugs, sleep deprivation, stress, psychiatric problems, or some other cause, unfortunately these sorts of wild slides of megalomania rarely end well. It is a sad public decline away from reality in the vein of those who were somehow damaged in their meteoric rise to the tops of their fields: Howard Hughes, Kanye West, Britney Spears, Mel Gibson, Michael Jackson, Sam Bankman-Fried, Harvey Weinstein.

I truly hope Elon finds a way to pull it together. Despite the haters, it’s undeniable that he is/was a generational outlier like Steve Jobs, Edison, Henry Ford, or any other of a small number of people who could rally resources and talent to deliver incredible, world-changing results.

Best of luck with your investment.",2025-03-17 17:38:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jdimnd/why_i_decided_to_panic_first/

1j8uu5k,Trump just advertised buying a Tesla,"If you had told me even just 1 year ago if I thought it were possible for Trump to advertise buying a Tesla, or literally any EV, I would've said you were crazy. But here we are.

Today Trump apparently posted on truth social saying that in order to stand with Elon against unjust attacks he would be buying a Tesla. I don't think people realize how massive this is.

Tesla's mission is to transition the world to renewable energy. Well, how do you do that if half the country stubbornly mostly does not want to even consider buying an EV? That, I think, is likely much less of a problem now than it was yesterday.

This isn't just bullish for Tesla, this is a huge win for environmentalism. We need conservatives to buy EVs, we can't just pretend that half the country doesn't exist when trying to solve this problem after all, and I stand by the fact that Elon really has been the only one seriously trying to market EVs to conservatives. And now all that effort has paid off.

I think every argument about Trump being bad for EVs and environmentalism is now turned on its head. If Trump is telling people ""I bought a tesla because it was the right thing to do"" then even though he supports increasing fossil fuel production he is helping popularize Tesla and in the longer term that means significantly more profits for Tesla, which means more grid battery production, which means grid-scale renewable energy becomes much more cost competitive with gas. And we all know that once solar panels and batteries get cheap enough they could easily replace coal and gas as our primary source of electricity in this country. Too many advantages to ignore (virtual powerplants, gridless homes, stable electricity networks, easily scalable power plants, low risk working environments, etc.).

Sure the economy is shitting the bed right now but once Trump is done with his trade war it will eventually return to normal. And at THAT time, that is when we will see the main benefits of what has just happened. The future is very bright!!!

1j455de,Elon & Tesla are getting short end of the stick with support for Trump/DOGE - What is the end game?,"Hey there, let’s chat about what’s been going on with Elon Musk lately, especially with his ties to Trump and that whole DOGE thing. Honestly, it’s not looking too great these days, and I’ve been mulling it over. Tesla’s stock has taken a real beating—down more than 35% from its peak, which is tough to stomach if you’re an investor or just a fan of the company. And it’s not just numbers on a screen; people are getting upset in the real world too. There’s been vandalism hitting Tesla cars and even the charging stations, which is crazy to think about. It feels like there’s this growing wave of frustration—or even outright anger—directed at Tesla and the folks who drive them, not just here but all over the globe.

I can’t help but wonder where this is all headed. Some countries might start slapping extra tariffs on Tesla vehicles, maybe as a way to push back against Elon’s moves or just to make a point. It’s like the walls are closing in a bit, you know? And for what? I keep asking myself if Elon’s big gamble here is backfiring. Teaming up with Trump and jumping into this DOGE mess—did he accidentally set himself up for a fall? Trump’s the kind of guy who might lean on Elon for as long as it suits him, then just walk away when he’s done, leaving Elon holding the bag. And that bag could be full of some pretty massive losses.

It’s hard not to think about the bigger picture too. If the political winds shift—say, the next president’s a Democrat—things could get even dicier for Elon. People are already tossing around wild ideas, like him facing legal trouble or, worst case, even prison. I don’t know if it’ll go that far, but it’s the kind of thing that keeps you up at night if you’re rooting for him. Right now, it’s tough to spot the silver lining. What’s the upside for Elon or Tesla in all this chaos? I’m scratching my head trying to figure it out, because from where I’m sitting, it looks like a rough road ahead with not much to show for it.

1j2zls5,Tesla electric car sales plunge again in Australia – Model 3 down more than 81 per cent,"The retooling hypothesis doesn't hold up. 81% drop YoY for model 3.

Tesla's EV sales in Australia have plunged, with combined Model 3 and Model Y sales dropping 71.9% in February compared to last year. Model 3 sales fell over 81%, raising questions about demand beyond just inventory shortages.

Some analysts suggest that Elon Musk’s political alignment with far-right figures and Trump is affecting Tesla's brand, especially in Europe, where sales are also plummeting. Protests have occurred at U.S. Tesla dealerships, and a Canadian petition seeks to revoke Musk's citizenship.

Tesla stock has reversed post-election gains, and key executives—including board chair Robyn Denholm and Musk’s brother Kimbal—have sold significant amounts of Tesla shares.

Meanwhile, competition from Chinese EV makers like BYD is increasing, and Polestar’s numbers show mixed results, with new models gaining traction. More industry-wide EV sales data is expected soon.

I think it's fair to discuss what options exist to reverse this trend? Outing Musk will likely help bring back EV demand but might also bring the stock back down to a reasonable valuation.

1j0wznr,"Tesla Sales Drop, Some Numbers and Considerations:","**TLDR**: The drop in Tesla’s sales is due to the retooling of the Model Y and the lack of inventory.

 

**Let’s Start with the Basics:**

The Tesla Model Y alone accounts for two-thirds, or about 67%, of all Tesla sales: 1.2 million out of 1.8 million annual production. The Model Y was, in 2023 and also in 2024, the world’s best-selling single model of car, . When considering revenue, the Model Y outperforms its competition by 50-70%. When considering profits (gross), the Model Y likely surpasses the rest of the top 10 combined, excluding the Ford F150 and the Model 3 (10th in the ranking with 500k sales). [source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/239229/most-sold-car-models-worldwide/#:~:text=The%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20was,closely%20by%20the%20Toyota%20Corolla)

  
  


Tesla finished 2024 with no cars in inventory. Tesla's average has always been around 18 days of production, while the automotive industry average is 90 days, and 60 days is considered excellent (Toyota). Consider that this is actually the number of days from when the car leaves the factory until it reaches the customer “ready to drive,” so this number also includes transit times and the fact that the customer has to physically pick up the car. For a Model 3 produced in China to reach the customer in Europe, it takes about 30-40 days.

Tesla finished 2024 with 12 days of inventory, down from 19 days the previous quarter (highlighted in green), and sold 40k more Model 3/Y in the fourth quarter than it produced (highlighted in red). Considering that cars (still) don't drive themselves to the customer's garage, 12 days is likely the lowest possible inventory, and the lowest number of days in inventory since I started following this company in 2018.



https://preview.redd.it/a77bzmgu62me1.png?width=1954&format=png&auto=webp&s=23307eb89941520a0ee147fa7c1883dba542960b

(P.S. If you look at Q1 2024, the inventory is at a “catastrophic”  28 days. What happened last year in Q1 that extended the transit time of all the ships? The Red Sea crisis, which at the time was portrayed by the press as a disaster.)

To recap: Tesla ended 2024 with no inventory, and at the beginning of 2025 (second week of January), they started retooling the 4 factories that produce the Model Y, which alone accounts for 67% of sales. The retooling time is between 4 and 6 weeks, and we need to add 20 days, or about 3 weeks, for these cars to reach their customers. This means that in January, Tesla has essentially run out of Model Ys in almost the entire world. 

In February, Model Y sales will be practically zero because the factories are finishing retooling and the cars are in transit. We will see a recovery starting in March, with a full recovery expected in April/May.

Therefore, the various articles that talk about “Tesla halved its sales because of Musk” are pushing a certain narrative. Even if it were true, Musk made the (awful) announcement on January 21, and it takes time for the news to spread—around January 23-24. To say that in the remaining week of January, the last 20% of the month, Tesla’s sales were halved because of Musk is absurd. In fact, the fact that sales dropped “only” by 45% in the face of a 67% drop in production due to retooling shows that sales are still holding up.  
I can already predict that many articles this month will talk about the sales drop in February, which will be 60-70% lower than February of last year, when in reality the issue is that the cars haven’t arrived yet. The same applies to March, but the numbers might be down by 40%.



 Look at the numbers, not the emotions that the tabloids sell you.

In fact, when we talk about customer loyalty, which automotive brand dominates?

1iz57g8,Waymo is unprofitable,"When comparing Waymo and Tesla's autonomous driving approaches, several key disadvantages for Waymo emerge, primarily related to their operational model:
 * Geofencing Limitations:
   * Waymo's technology often relies on highly detailed, pre-mapped areas (geofencing). This means their autonomous vehicles primarily operate within these defined zones. This significantly limits their operational scope compared to Tesla, which aims for broader, unrestricted autonomy.
   * Expanding beyond these geofenced areas requires extensive mapping and testing, which is time-consuming and expensive.
 * Scaling and Infrastructure:
   * Waymo's business model, which involves deploying its own fleet of autonomous vehicles, requires significant capital investment in vehicles, maintenance, and infrastructure.
   * Scaling this model to a national or global level presents substantial logistical and financial challenges.
 * Data Collection:
   * Tesla's approach, which leverages data from millions of customer vehicles, provides a massive real-world dataset for training its AI. This gives Tesla a significant advantage in terms of data volume and diversity.
   * Waymo, while collecting very high quality data, does not have the volume of real world driving data that tesla has access to.
 * Consumer vehicle integration:
   * Tesla has the advantage of having its self driving software integrated into consumer owned vehicles. This allows for a much wider spread use of its technology, and allows for the gathering of much more real world driving data. Waymo is focused on Robotaxi and commercial applications, thus limiting their data collection, and consumer exposure.
In essence, Waymo's reliance on precise mapping and its fleet-based model creates limitations in scalability and operational flexibility compared to Tesla's data-driven, broader-application approach.


Waymo utilize tons of different sensors while Tesla only use cameras. 

It a no brainier that Tesla is going wipe out Waymo.

A current rumor on X that Elon said he will be “working 24/7 on DOGE to cut up to $2 TRILLION from the federal budget.”

I know some investors have been concerned about Elon’s focus on his companies. I felt this way after he first got bogged down with X. But then I saw that after he spent a few months through critical changes, he brought in a CEO to take over the day to day. 

And now that I think about it, I see potential long term benefits to the Tesla brand. If Elon ends up being right, surfaces a ton of government waste and his methods are validated resulting in saving the American taxpayer a ton of money, I think this will benefit the brand value among those on the right and in the middle. 

You can also imagine somewhere down the line that if he’s very successful with his cuts and findings, that Trump will give him some sort of major public recognition for what he’s done for the country. 

As an investor and someone who works in tech, I’ve followed Elon closely for a long time. But now his name is becoming much more commonplace through the media. He just has to deliver and prove the haters wrong and his supporters right.

1jozzx2,Musk’s Politics Don’t Define Tesla’s Value,"While I agree that Musk's actions in DC are reckless and inappropriate, we should not equate stock price to company value, now or when it was well over $400/share a few months ago. December's and today's prices represent emotions, not any rational evaluation. Similarly, short-term market reactions do not indicate long-term company value. Some other thoughts investors should keep in mind:

* TSLA is still the most significant upside/risk of any single stock I can find.
   * Tesla's long-term value to investors and the world has almost nothing to do with selling cars to consumers.
   * Despite that, Teslas are:
      * the safest and cleanest vehicles in the world, both in production and use
      * outstanding in comfort and performance
      * more affordable than other cars in their class, and many lower
      * have the highest margins of any mass producer
   * That results in the most profit and the greatest good of any comparable product. Yet, all that profit is just boot-strap funds for the arbitrarily greater good and profit to come in the next few years.
   * Tesla delivers all this while taking better care of their employees, especially factory workers, than the rest of the industry, including union shops.
* Tesla still stands out as the most moral and ethical major car maker, even accounting for Musk's recent politics.
   * You must look beyond the headlines and FUD stories of the last two decades to understand this, because the rest of them pay:
      * the advertising/protection money that keeps their evil acts out of the spotlight
      * the lobbyists/political money that keeps the governments off their backs
   * All that protection money also puts a negative spin on everything around Tesla because Tesla is their biggest threat.
   * When you do that research, especially if you include connections with fossil fuels, there is little left to subjectivity.
* Even beyond all his astounding technical and business accomplishments, Musk's greatest miracle is convincing the wing-nuts on the right to become interested in electric cars, and next, sustainability in general.
   * Tesla and Musk are mission-driven: accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
   * Placating wing-nuts on the left who claim to be on board already does nothing to accelerate, while convincing 1/4 of those who are politically resistant is a monumental effect.
   * Look at the search trends for ""buy Tesla"" if you need a visualization.
   * The middle of the herd always follows the rest.

Ultimately, Musk is not responsible for being allowed to do things the way he has always done. Only the President can force a change in that regard, and only Congress can legally force a change in the presidency. This level of access for DOGE and Musk is a symptom of a broken political duopoly and the forces perpetuating it from behind the scenes.

In any case, these emotions should not dictate our investment decisions. They should make us reevaluate as the world continues to change, but we should not react to the whims of the media lest we be controlled by those we should resist the most.

Displacing our resistance on Tesla is ineffective and is just the kind of distraction they want.",2025-04-01 16:31:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jozzx2/musks_politics_dont_define_teslas_value/

1id6dq9,How has this subreddit become an Elon Musk hate club? (+ FUD riddled bear case by random idiot),"EDIT: I wrote this expecting Q4 earnings to be on Friday, for some reason. The timing is accidental.  
  
I'm surprised to learn most people here don't seem to like Elon Musk all that much.

TSLA is near all time highs, most folks here seem to be worried about the upcoming call and given that they're in this subreddit in the first place, they're probably invested in Tesla. My question is, why? Why not cash out, now that the stock is so high?

I'll give you a quick, probably unoriginal bear thesis to get your money woof and justify the flair:

The bull case is based on AI-driving, and Tesla basically becoming the world's only major car maker. It is highly likely that neither of these things pan out the way investors hope, due to Elon Musk, who's made all those promises, clearly spiraling into madness.

Things that would be disastrous for Tesla (stock), which are all likely to happen this year: A falling out between Elon Musk and MAGA world, a trade war with China, a boycott in Europe and US coastal states over the 'accidental' Nazi salute, which he never claimed was accidental; Elon doing something even more erratic, Tesla switching to lidar to overcome physical limitations of using only cameras, thus invalidating the entire robo-cab vision; Cybertruck turning out to be a flop, legacy car makers actually having time to get their sh\*t together because Musk refuses to develop a sub $25k hatchback.

Once one of these cards fall, the entire house crashes down (at least, to a reasonable valuation, because Tesla is still a good company, just way overvalued).

This is coming from a former Elon fanboy, and someone who believed that Tesla would actually be worth its current valuation one day, and be producing about 10 times as many cars as it does currently. There are now serious threats to that potential, and they're all caused by the man who created it in the first place.

Tesla should've introduced a sub 25k car last year, instead they don't even have one in the works. It should've used Lidar in its self-driving technology, instead it only uses cameras which, any photographer will tell you, have physical limitations.  It shouldn't have misled people about the robot, its CEO shouldn't have done the Nazi salute and alienate literally every European country and US coastal state.

Why does the Cybertruck even exist? Why was that robo-taxi even introduced? When Tesla proposed the Roadster and those Semis, the company actually made sense. Now it just does random weird stuff, weird stuff that doesn't appear to be successful at all.

And yet, the company is valued as if we're in an alternate universe where Tesla did build the Semi, did build the Roadster, and most importantly, did build the Model 2, which would've been a $25-ish Golf-like car with a steering wheel.",2025-01-29 22:19:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1id6dq9/how_has_this_subreddit_become_an_elon_musk_hate/

Do I start selling my TSLA shares and looking into Chinese stocks?

\-

# Here's a brief synopsis of the video:

* **Introduction and Setup**:
   * The challenge involves testing BYD’s autonomous driving capabilities under extreme conditions in a crowded, rural Chinese city at night, with a mix of people and scooters on the roads.
   * The test vehicle is the Denza G9 GT, capable of urban autonomous driving but not yet fully updated for parking features.
* **Initial Observations**:
   * The car adjusts smoothly to dynamic situations like people walking onto the road, scooters changing lanes unexpectedly, and non-standard traffic patterns.
   * It handles missing lane markings and unusual left-turn signals well, demonstrating reliable lane-changing and speed adjustments.
* **Complex Traffic Scenarios**:
   * Encounters included scooters suddenly appearing, pedestrians jaywalking, and erratically parked vehicles.
   * The AI adjusts speed, yields to pedestrians, and navigates intersections effectively, though it struggles with areas lacking traffic signals or clear road markings.
* **Challenges with Local Traffic Norms**:
   * In some areas, straight and left-turn signals work simultaneously, leading to chaos.
   * The car successfully handles these situations, adhering to traffic rules while ensuring safety for nearby scooters and pedestrians.
* **Specific Difficulties**:
   * In a school zone, the car yielded to crossing students, causing a delay that led to a violation notification for obstructing traffic.
   * This highlighted differences in local driving expectations and challenges faced by autonomous systems in adhering to nuanced human behaviors.
* **Performance in Crowded Areas**:
   * The car safely navigated through congested areas like shopping districts with heavy foot and scooter traffic.
   * Despite tight spaces and unpredictable movements, the AI avoided collisions and maintained a smooth ride.
* **Critiques and Reflections**:
   * Observations on China’s traffic system pointed out inefficiencies like conflicting signals and reckless driving behaviors.
   * The narrator expressed frustration over receiving a traffic violation for prioritizing pedestrian safety.
* **Conclusion**:
   * The test showcased the potential and limitations of the BYD vehicle’s autonomous driving in extreme real-world conditions.
   * The system’s reliance on LIDAR and its ability to handle chaotic traffic were impressive, but legal and cultural challenges remain significant barriers.
   * Questions were raised about whether similar autonomous features would be released in other markets like Korea.",2025-01-28 07:35:26,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1ibwef1/if_byd_has_fsd_v13_already_in_china_whats_teslas/

1fxayka,Reminder — Q3 2023 was a down quarter due to planned factory outages.,"A lot of mixed signals going on in this subreddit this week. Some exuberance, some lamentation of decayed growth, some simultaneous sentiment that growth is magically back on the table, and frankly a total grab-bag of other assorted takes. 

One thing keeps getting missed in the analysis though, and I'll be brief about it — Q3 2023 [was a down quarter due to planned factory upgrades](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-deliveries-expected-fall-plant-shutdowns-soft-demand-2023-09-29/) and retooling for the launch of Highland, which began China sales in October of 2023. You can go back at Tesla's [own Q3 2023 deck](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q3-2023-Update-3.pdf) which mentions the factory shutdowns several times, or [contemporary reporting which also mentioned it](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/business/tesla-third-quarter-sales.html).

Looking at the numbers quarter-by-quarter, the aberration is clear. It's hard to stay where Tesla would have ended up had Q3 2023 been a 'clean' quarter, but a linear interpolation (which isn't perfect by any means) between Q2 and Q4 would have expectations for Q3 at around 475k. Instead it missed that by 40,000 units: 

* Q1 — 423k 📈
* Q2 — 466k 📈
* **Q3 — 435k** 📉
* Q4 — 485k 📈

Without that downtime, the 2024 YoY growth would almost certainly evaporate, and compared with the interpolation, Q3 2024's numbers of 463,000 disappoint. There's a good reminder here to always be careful when you do analysis — it isn't enough to simply compare one quarter to another one arbitrarily, or to even take year-over-year figures and call it a day.

Tesla Inc. operates as a multinational automotive and clean energy company. The companies bulk of revenue currently comes from there manufacturing and delivery of Electric Vehicles, as well as related products and services for the fleet. Meanwhile Tesla's investments into energy generation and storage have already begun paying massive returns, showing a Continued Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 94.71% since beginning operations in 2015. Heading into the next decade Tesla hopes to gain 2 new revenue streams for the company through there investments in The Robotaxi and The Optimus Robot. Both investments plan to overtake Tesla's top revenue stream of Electric Vehicles, moving Tesla towards its proper company description: an autonomous research and development company. Today Tesla primarily operates as an Electric Vehicle company giving them a strong backbone of consistent revenue and autonomous data from the fleet to go towards there investments. In the future Tesla will see a flip in revenue with the top spots going to Optimus Robots and RoboTaxi's. While consistent revenue growth will be shown from Electric Vehicles and energy generation and storage, the growth will not be strong enough to compete with the new investments. In conclusion Tesla Inc's continued backbone of Electric Vehicles and energy generation and storage, paired with new investments into Optimus Robot and Robotaxi make Tesla Inc (TSLA) the best energy company to own over the next decade.

1dqpxdo,Must-Know: The SEC’s Next Move Against Elon Musk,"Hello.  
I recently came across an article in The Wall Street Journal titled “[Elon Musk and the SEC Are on a Collision Course Again](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/elon-musk-and-the-sec-are-on-a-collision-course-again-6cb1d1b9).”

I decided to do a deep dive into the whole thing and have concluded **it is likely that the SEC will charge Musk and seek to ban him from serving as an officer or director of any public company**.

If you think that's ridiculous, think again.

**Why?**  
Because the SEC has already done that before.

-----

**Don't believe me?**  
Here is the SEC's [official press release](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-219) from the last time Musk was in trouble *(the ""funding secured to take Tesla private"" tweet)*.

>The SEC’s complaint ... seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, civil penalties, and a **bar prohibiting Musk from serving as an officer or director of a public company.**

So, if the SEC already sought that back then, why *wouldn't* they do it again?  
Especially since Musk is now a repeat offender.

-----

Furthermore, I found out that Musk has been legally fighting the SEC in anticipation.  
However, just recently (May 2024), Musk has been **court-ordered** to give the long awaited testimony the SEC has been asking for. This is not an opinion. It's [Case № 3:23-mc-80253-JSC](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.419113/gov.uscourts.cand.419113.52.0_2.pdf).

The parties have agreed it will not last more than five hours.  
And, of course, those upcoming five hours will be critical.

I have already posted my full research elsewhere: [Elon Musk 🆚 the SEC: Delays, Dollars, and Drama](https://medium.com/illumination/elon-musk-the-sec-delays-dollars-and-drama-4bc9cf7ac6fe)

I've already asked permission from your Mods.  
The full thing is [there](https://medium.com/illumination/elon-musk-the-sec-delays-dollars-and-drama-4bc9cf7ac6fe) so *you* can make up your own mind.

I explain how Musk purchased TWTR shares, Rule 13d-1(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the problem, the reason why, and everything that has happened in between with all the links to all the sources so *you* can verify things for yourself.

I don't know how this will end. But I know what to expect if/when the SEC sends its press release.  
As TSLA investors, I would assume you would want to know this information in advance.

Have a great day.[](https://medium.com/illumination/elon-musk-the-sec-delays-dollars-and-drama-4bc9cf7ac6fe)",2024-06-28 17:58:22,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1dqpxdo/mustknow_the_secs_next_move_against_elon_musk/

Those who have wanted a big SUV have already bought a Y, and now that other manufacturers have released and are releasing regular-sized cars (C and B segments), also as electric cars, Tesla's market share is starting to melt at a terrible pace.

And when you add to this the shocking damage to the reputation that Musk is causing to the company, we will see how long Tesla will continue.

Perhaps Musk's intention was to slow down Tesla's product development, so that Telsa's business would go more and more in the AI ​​direction and compete with Uber, so that Musk could extort a 25% share for himself, threatening to take away the future AI-uber business.

1ctmdup,When do we really think TSLA will get *full* FSD approval in China?,"I feel like when this happens it will provide enough data for analysts to believe worldwide FSD is coming and price that revenue into their price targets. Especially since Tesla can turn on large fleet of robotaxis pretty much instantly.

Just a plan but still useful guidelines…in Tesla’s [Master Plan, Part Deux](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux), they expect worldwide FSD regulatory approval happens once 6 billion Tesla FSD miles have been driven. We reached 1B in April 2024. Purely off of this estimate, with 5 billion miles to go and Tesla's fleet now doing 1 billion FSD miles every 2-3 months, we can guesstimate another 10-15 months (January - June 2025) before receiving worldwide regulatory FSD approval. 

  
Keep in mind testing robotaxis on taxis in China may shorten the time down from 2-3 months to drive 1 billion miles and of course the 6 billion miles in Master Plan Deux was just a goal…

So thinking about where China stands on approvals, [China Daily](https://cnevpost.com/2024/05/08/china-may-support-tesla-testing-robotaxi-report/) stated Tesla still needs to receive approval to \*\*collect and transmit the data\*\* needed to train Tesla vehicles on driver-assistance features before China gives them full FSD approval. 

  
What are your thoughts on how long these approvals would take in China?",2024-05-16 20:06:27,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1ctmdup/when_do_we_really_think_tsla_will_get_full_fsd/
1cnbci2,"Former Manufacturing Engineer, wanted to share some insight I was sharing w a non-engineering friend of mine on TSLA stock after spending a ton of time digging in to the company and financials.","**My Background:**

I used to be a Manufacturing Engineer and in the engineering leadership development program for one of the largest aerospace/defense corporations in the world.  I spent a lot of time improving manufacturing processes, and offering feedback to design teams on design for manufacturing. With that intro, I wanted to share my insights I recently was noticing about Tesla's touchscreen design. I am copying all this direct from a text I sent to a friend a few days ago 😎:

**From text:**

One of the biggest differentiators for Tesla now that it is well-established is the almost complete lack of buttons.  I would be willing to bet most people do not realize how huge of a competitive advantage this is.  When I was at <my old company> we literally studied the manufacturing efficiencies of Toyota.  As an example, when GM went bankrupt, they had over 200 different part numbers for “horn” assemblies.  That is mind-blowing.  It is like a mess of spaghetti when you think about all of the engineering diagrams, and also the overlap of design.  So picture you have some issue where a screw hole is having fatigue fracture after a few years in one specific part of the horn assembly. Stuff like this is very common in newer designs for example.  You literally learn by trial and error.  Then the engineers really study the hell out of what is going on, and make a version 2 with the modifications.  At Toyota they only had 2 models of horn assembly, so when you fix a problem like this, at absolute most, you only have to fix it in 2 different part numbers.  But at GM depending on the design overlap, you may have to redesign hundreds of different assemblies.  It is a literal nightmare.  You would have so many updates to do, you would literally have to have a gigantic team of engineers overhauling all of these horn assemblies.  There is no way around that short of just not making replacement parts for your vehicles, which would be like a nuclear bomb blowing your brand value to pieces. 

Over a product life-cycle, you will literally have potentially dozens (or more) revisions to the part diagrams. Meaning you keep learning from little mistakes, failures in production, and manufacturing inefficiencies (meaning parts that are hard to build) and you redesign them to be easier to build.  And then a company that is doing things “very well” like Toyota is like “Holy Shit!  That horn assembly right there… we have revised that design 100 times, and it is literally absolute perfection.  We can build that thing to 6 sigma reliability where you have fewer than 3.4 defects per million. This is like the holy grail!”

The key being that it takes a tremendous amount of effort and revising to get a product to that level of maturity.  Lots of money, and lots of hard work.

But this is where the Tesla advantage comes in

See, by Tesla mostly having no buttons or switches, they eliminate at bare minimum dozens of parts and wiring assemblies, and Assembly Instructions for assemblers, or assembly coding for robots, that all have to go through these product revision processes.  And there is a huge economic moat for Tesla in this regard, because they started it this way pretty much from the beginning.  So the cars have mostly been designed for well over a decade now with none of this.  Yet for Toyota to compete on this, or Ford, Honda, GM, Stellantis, all of them, they have to take their holy grail button/wiring/connector designs, that have gone through literally 100s of revisions, and possibly 10s or 100s of thousands of engineering man hours to get them to this stage, and chunk them in the trash, and redesign everything.  This would cause a reliability problem in the vehicles which would tarnish the brands in the interim.  And this is a massive advantage. So while Tesla did all of this stuff right from the beginning and built everything with this focus on efficiency of design and manufacturing, these others are doing everything the same, because “If it ain’t broke, not only don’t fix it, but please don’t take all of the engineers 1000s of hours, throw them in the trash and make us start from scratch again”

And the cherry on top of all of this, is that if you build a button on the side of a seat in a regular car for example, and people bitch about it in car reviews like “I think it’s kind of hard to reach this button. It should be next to the steering wheel” - from an engineering perspective, that is like “Oh my god, we have to redesign the whole fucking seat and dash.” Because when you move a switch panel, all the interior of the seat has to be moved around. Same on the dash. All the wiring assemblies have to be carefully routed through ridiculously cramped spaces, and assemblers have to have AI (assembly instructions) to tell them how to do all of it.  So all that has to be redone.  On a Tesla, if someone thinks its confusing to adjust something, you just send an update over wifi to the UI.  Almost like magic.  All the cars are just fixed probably by one or two software guys writing the code to fix it.  Compare those two from a cost perspective.  THIS is one huge reason why Tesla is kicking ass on the net margins.",2024-05-08 18:14:15,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1cnbci2/former_manufacturing_engineer_wanted_to_share/

SuperCharger team was by all accounts the best EV-charger team in North America by miles. That has to have been worth something. Why didn't Musk decide to sell this team for $5 or $10 billion instead of destroying it if he felt \*that\* strongly about it? Wouldn't such a team be an incredible asset just in and of itself, even if sold without IPs/properties? It seems like nonsense.

1cg33wt,"Down on metrics, up on speculation","I have no shorts, no calls, and am overall neutral, but I do find the valuation (even at this point), extremely generous. I sold most my stocks between October 2021 and November 2021. I think people have lost sight of the goal, and traded it in for the hopes of getting rich.

So TSLA is up 35% in 5 days because of:

1. More Musk hearsay  
2. Positive misinformation

Been following the stock since release of Model S, and I must say, this thing has gone from valuation based on real metrics and a path to meet goals, to speculations of all kinds and manners.

For example, jump on Musk calling Tesla not a car company, which we've hear before, as he's called Tesla a bunch of start ups working under one roof. Why should the stock jump on him repeating things? Let's not even get into FSD.

Now, the stock jump because articles are misinterpreting what happened in China. Tesla passing China's cyber security requirements doesn't have to do much with with actual FSD, it applies to all connected vehicles, of all brands sold in China. Basically Tesla promised not to collect, store, or sell sensitive data outside of China, and ensures that the data collected isn't personal. The other side of that is in the US, Tesla uses Google maps, which isn't allowed in China, so they haven't been able to use Autopilot. Using Baidu will allow Tesla to turn on some features of Autopilot soon.

How will this effect sales? We don't know. I just think it's very interesting that there has been such a dramatic pump on some not so dramatic news.

I also think it's interesting how all the bulls are hyped about the pump, yet, I'm sure they never could have guessed all of this happening, lol. Of course the same would have happened with the bears, but I feel like there's more metric data for a bear case than a bull case.",2024-04-29 16:14:34,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1cg33wt/down_on_metrics_up_on_speculation/
