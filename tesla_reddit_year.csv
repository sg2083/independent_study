1jrtaam,Companies with a large footprint in the US should benefit from the tariffs?,"Someone smarter than me please post a counterargument.

  
My reasoning is that because the reciprocal tariffs increase the cost of imported foreign goods, domestic goods will be cheaper/favorable. This is the whole idea, to shift a focus back to domestic US manufacturing and purchasing. Therefore, companies that don't need to shift and already produce domestically should benefit as consumers and businesses shift to domestic options? The flip side is that if foreign countries retaliate, this would offset the wanted shift obviously.  
So I started listing companies with a large footprint already in the US or that just solely already manufacture the MAJORITY of their stuff in the US:

Tesla, RIVN, Nucor, Steel Dynamics, Deere & Co, TXN, MU, Exxon, Chevron, LMT, RTX, BA.

Meanwhile, a company like Apple produces 80-90% of their iPhones in China and are definitely screwed.

1jrqwdb,Rocket Lab vs SpaceX: The Anti‚ÄëMusk Space Investment Campaign,"RKLB: The Musk‚ÄëFree Space Stock Ready to Soar üöÄ

Elon Musk‚Äôs antics and political ties are starting to spook investors ‚Äì from protests at Tesla showrooms to falling sales . Enter Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB), a pure-play space company with no Musk baggage and strong fundamentals. Rocket Lab just posted record revenue of $436 million in 2024 (up 78% YoY) , yet the stock has pulled back after a recent dip, creating an opportunity. Here‚Äôs why RKLB could be a stellar long-term pick:

* Beating Expectations, Despite the Dip: Q4 2024 revenue jumped 121% year-over-year . But cautious Q1 guidance (\~$120M vs $135M expected) spooked the market, and RKLB stock fell \~11% on that news ‚Äì now down \~30% in the past month . This pullback looks technical, not fundamental, as the company is still growing fast.
* Strong Backlog & Partnerships: Rocket Lab‚Äôs order backlog hit $1.1¬†billion by end-2024 , nearly half from government contracts. They build satellites for NASA/DoD and just won a role in the U.S. Space Force‚Äôs NSSL program (a launch contract pool worth up to $5.6B) . In short, reliable revenue streams backed by government and commercial clients.
* Upcoming Catalyst ‚Äì Neutron Rocket: In 2025, Rocket Lab plans to debut Neutron, a medium-lift, partially reusable rocket aimed at competing with SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 . Management confirms it‚Äôs on track for H2 2025 launch . Success could unlock larger payload missions and massive new contracts. (Some skeptics think it slips to 2026 , but even a slight delay doesn‚Äôt derail the vision.)
* Elon Who? Unlike SpaceX, Rocket Lab is publicly traded and not tied to Musk‚Äôs volatility. Musk‚Äôs close alliance with politicians and controversial behavior are now seen as business risks . By contrast, Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck stays out of politics and focuses on execution. That makes RKLB a cleaner investment narrative if you‚Äôre wary of ‚Äúkey-man risk.‚Äù

Bottom line: Rocket Lab offers high growth (launch and satellite services) without the Musk drama. Analysts are bullish too (price targets range \~$24‚Äì33 , well above the current price). With the stock trading off its highs and Elon‚Äôs shine wearing off, RKLB could be ready for liftoff in portfolios looking for the next space success story. Do your DD, but this under-the-radar rocket company might just shoot for the moon.¬†

1jrpy8l,Technology stocks,"Everybody is saying that we can now buy certain stocks discounted.

However, I noticed that most of them went down around 20-25 percent ( Amazon slightly more), which seems everything went down the same. And that is not 100 percent logical.

If stock prices are going down because of probable less revenue and less profits, these drops in my view should not be the same.

1. Apple - 75 percent revenue are hardware. Almost all of it done abroad. Apple should be heavily negatively influenced from tarrifs, and in fact its one of the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù ones with a fall of around 20-22 percent or so. 

2. Amazon - as mentioned Amazon went down more than Apple from a similar stock price of cca 230 dollars. This is because of the China trade war, and for Amazon I see an exception to my analysis.
3. Alphabet - I did not really check in detail. Shouldnt most od their revenue be services and nothing to do with tariffs? 
Alphabet/Google went from 200 to now 144. Thats again more than 25 percent.

4. META - again, what do they have to do with tariffs?
Drop around same like Google, a bit less.

5. Microsoft - again same as Alphabet and Google. Should it be really?

Tesla is out of my analysis since it was never really deeply connected to the rest in growth and fall.

Point of my quick and short analysis, am I the only one who believes not every tech stock should have suffered the same recently ?

1jroid1,Market downturn trigger?,"I scrolled a little bit, and most of what i am seeing on the sub is about tarrifs. Is anyone talking about the impact the downturn of TSLA may have had in precipitating the overall market event? 

I don't currently have access to the information, but i would imagine that a sudden - truly unexpected - drop in a blue chip value stock like TSLA would cause an institutions balance sheet to become very lopsided. I'm thinking the current sell off is due to deleveraging against short positions.

Tarrifs are ugly... political and civil unrest - sure... a bit scary, but that seems to have been fuel to the fire as the match was being lit.

Check my thoughts -  but I truly think EM may have gaffe'd the biggest gaffe that has ever been gaffed. Yes, no? Teslas market cap is down close to half a trillion dollars. That is huge. 

Edits to grammars 

There have been a few comments already. Tarriffs are very, very, very bad and we would be in the same situation whether or not TSLA dipped.

Ok... I see the errors in my thinking

1jrb0tf,What Musk Leaving DOGE Would Mean for Tesla Stock,"
While Tesla investors adjust to the global trade bombshell, Wall Street is adjusting to DOGE news.

CEO Elon Musk might be stepping back from his Washington, D.C. responsibilities and spending more time in Austin, Texas, soon.

Shares of the electric-vehicle maker were down 6.8% in premarket trading Friday at $249.02, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were dropping 2.7% and 2.8%, respectively. News that China will impose 34% retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. sent the entire market down.

The early Friday drop followed the stock's 5.5% on Thursday. President Donald Trump's tariffs announcement Wednesday evening simply surprised investors. The levies were much higher than expected, with reciprocal' tariff rates adjusted for 'currency manipulation and trade barriers.""

Tariff news is obscuring Wednesday's 5.3% gain for Tesla stock, which came despite disappointing delivery numbers. Tesla delivered some 337,000 cars, about 40,000 less than Wall Street expected and about 50,000 fewer than the first quarter of 2024.

News from Politico that Musk might end his DOGE career early not deliveries sent shares higher. Investors have worried for weeks the chief executive's political activities have been hurting Tesla's brand. That is why even unconfirmed reports sent shares higher. The White House called Politico's scoop ""garbage.""

Garbage or not, Wall Street appears to believe it's time for Musk to step back from DOGE.

Stepping back matters because it's a crucial time for Tesla, said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. Deliveries fell 13% year over year, and Tesla is supposed to be launching a new vehicle and a robotaxi service in 2025.

""With Musk spending considerable time helping the US government, the market may have questioned if Musk was distracted from his role in leading Tesla,"" added Goldstein in his Wednesday report. His fair value for Tesla stock is $250 a share.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote on Wednesday that Musk ""slowly but surely moving away from his leadership position in DOGE"" is very bullish for Tesla. He rates shares Buy and has a $450 price target for the stock.

Guggenheim analyst Ronald Jewsikow channeled rapper Eminem reviewing DOGE news. ""Guess who's back? back again. Elon's back wrote Jewsikow, playing on lyrics from the star's Without Me track. 'We would note this was already hinted at as early as last week...the narrative is a clear positive for Tesla, could soften some of the political backlash/perceived backlash, and could improve employee morale.""

Jewsikow rates shares Sell and has a $170 price target for shares.

What is a DOGE retreat worth to Tesla stock? That is hard to say. Tesla stock was about $425 a share before the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration. (At the time, first-quarter delivery estimates were closer to 450,000 vehicles.) Tesla stock closed on Thursday below $270 a share.

BofA strategist Savita Subramanian noted earlier this week that fund managers have been selling Tesla stock since the election. Some of that institutional selling might have been due to tariff fears or profit-taking. Some is likely because of Musk, and some of that money coming back could boost shares.

In the longer term, any rebound will depend on car buyers returning. Is any brand damage permanent? It's hard to know now.

It could be too late. J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman cut his first-quarter estimates after first-quarter deliveries confirmed ""unprecedented brand damage,"" he feared. Brinkman isn't sure what to make of the Politico story, ""what does seem clear, however, is that the trend in Tesla sales is worse than we and the market had appreciated.""

Brinkman rates Tesla stock Sell and has a $120 price target for the stock. CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson rates shares Buy and has a $360 price target for the stock.

In a recent report, he pointed out that some of the sales weakness was related to lower production of Tesla's most popular car, the Model Y. It was recently updated, causing some buyers to wait for the new model. Nelson sees a rebound coming in the second quarter.

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[¬†reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html)¬†the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India ‚Äî all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important¬†[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[¬†like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.¬†[So if this tips us into recession,¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",2025-04-03 18:13:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

1jqgunf,Why a China‚ÄìKorea‚ÄìJapan Free Trade Deal Would Be a Huge Win for BYD,"TL;DR: A tri-nation FTA would give BYD cheaper access to two lucrative markets, fortify its supply chain, and encourage more partnership with top-tier Japanese and Korean firms. All that translates to faster growth and possibly fatter profits for BYD. It‚Äôs the kind of macro tailwind that could make BYD‚Äôs ambitious global goals (like that 800k overseas sales target) even more achievable. As a BYD enthusiast, I‚Äôd be very excited to see this free trade deal happen ‚Äì it could be a sleeper catalyst for BYD‚Äôs stock in the long run.

 So let's talk BYD and free trade. Imagine China, South Korea, and Japan sign a free trade agreement (FTA) ‚Äì no tariffs, smoother trade, tighter supply chains. As a long-time BYD watcher, I genuinely think BYD would love this scenario. Here‚Äôs my take on why BYD could be one of the biggest beneficiaries:

More BYDs on Korean and Japanese Roads

Improved export access = more sales. BYD has been aggressively expanding into both Japan and South Korea, and an FTA would throw the doors wide open. In Japan, BYD only entered in 2023 and sold 2,223 EVs in 2024 ‚Äì surprisingly surpassing Toyota‚Äôs EV sales (2,038 units) in their own home market‚Äã. That‚Äôs a tiny fraction of Japan‚Äôs ~4 million annual auto sales, but it shows BYD‚Äôs potential. They‚Äôre so bullish that they plan to open 100 dealerships in Japan by 2025‚Äã. Now, picture those BYD showrooms if exports face zero trade barriers. Japanese EV adoption is just getting started (EVs were <2% of Japan‚Äôs auto sales in 2024‚Äã), so easier access could let BYD ride the coming wave as Japan catches up on electrification.

In South Korea, BYD is also making moves. They just launched models like the Dolphin hatchback (aka Atto 3) and Seal sedan in early 2025 with aggressive pricing (around $21k) aimed at undercutting Hyundai and Kia‚Äã. BYD literally said they‚Äôre in Korea ‚Äúfor the long haul‚Äù and will start with affordable EVs to gain a foothold‚Äã chosun.comThe Korean EV market is growing (about 99,000 EVs sold in 2024, ~6% of total car sales‚Äã), and Korean consumers have shown they‚Äôll buy foreign EVs if the deal is good ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs sales in Korea jumped 548% last year to nearly 30k units wants a piece of that action, and a tri-nation FTA would only accelerate this. With freer trade, exporting more vehicles into Korea and Japan becomes simpler and cheaper, allowing BYD to scale up dealerships and marketing without so much red tape.

Let‚Äôs not forget BYD‚Äôs broader global push: the company is already on fire overseas. In the first quarter of 2025, BYD‚Äôs overseas sales doubled, topping 206,000 NEVs (EVs + plug-in hybrids) sold outside China through March‚Äã. They‚Äôre aiming for 800,000 overseas sales in 2025, roughly double 2024‚Äôs level‚Äã. Gaining frictionless access to nearby wealthy markets like Japan and Korea could add significant volume on top of BYD‚Äôs growth in Europe, Latin America, etc. It‚Äôs basically low-hanging fruit next door. As one Reuters analysis noted, BYD sees ‚Äúgreat opportunities‚Äù in markets friendly to Chinese EVs‚Äã ‚Äì and an FTA would make Japan/Korea way more friendly by default.

Tariff-Free = Cheaper EVs (or Better Margins)

One immediate benefit of a free trade pact would be zero tariffs on cars and batteries moving between the three countries. This is huge for BYD. Right now, importing cars into South Korea incurs an 8% tariff, which BYD has even been absorbing itself to keep prices low‚Äã (Talk about commitment ‚Äì BYD literally ate the 8% tax just so Korean buyers wouldn‚Äôt feel it, making their EVs more competitively priced!). If a China-Korea FTA scrapped that duty, BYD could either drop prices further (boosting demand) or stop sacrificing that 8% off their margins. Either way, BYD wins.

In Japan, auto import tariffs are already pretty low (Japan has prided itself on open auto markets in terms of tariffs‚Äã). But an FTA would lock in zero tariffs on EVs and also likely cut duties on EV components. Think about batteries, for example. BYD not only makes cars but is a major battery producer; under free trade, shipping BYD‚Äôs batteries or battery cells to partners in Japan/Korea would be cheaper. Likewise, any high-tech parts BYD imports from Japan/Korea for its cars (semiconductors, camera systems, etc.) would drop in cost. It‚Äôs a supply chain cost advantage on both ends.

Crucially, a tri-country FTA would shield BYD from the kind of tariff threats popping up in the West. Europe has been mulling tariffs on Chinese EVs, and the U.S. has been generally hostile with trade barriers. BYD‚Äôs chairman has openly discussed how tariffs abroad are a concern and said BYD might respond by assembling cars locally to ‚Äúovercome tariffs‚Äù in those regions‚Äã. But if China, Japan, and Korea are freely trading, BYD doesn‚Äôt need costly local factories or workarounds for those markets ‚Äì they can ship finished cars directly. No 10% EU tariff equivalent, no Trump-style surprises. Just sell the car and bank the revenue. This kind of stable, tariff-free access would make Japan and Korea very attractive markets for BYD to focus on, since their cost advantage would fully translate to showroom prices. One Bloomberg piece even noted BYD‚Äôs $21k starting price in Korea undercuts local EVs by being so low‚Äã‚Äì remove tariffs and BYD could sustain such aggressive pricing more profitably.

Bottom line: lower tariffs = lower prices = more competitive BYD EVs. Given BYD‚Äôs strength is value-for-money, an FTA turbocharges that advantage in Japan and Korea.

Stronger East Asian EV Supply Chains

BYD isn‚Äôt just a carmaker; they‚Äôre an integrated EV supply chain beast (batteries, electronics, you name it). A free trade agreement would knit China, Japan, and South Korea‚Äôs industries closer, which plays right into BYD‚Äôs hands. These three countries combined account for nearly 40% of global manufacturing output, including dominating sectors like semiconductors, EVs, and batteries‚Äã. In other words, East Asia is already the powerhouse of the EV world ‚Äì and BYD is a major player in that powerhouse. If trade barriers drop, it becomes a lot easier to source the best components regionally and optimize costs.

For instance, Japan and South Korea are leaders in certain EV components: think of Japan‚Äôs electronics (chips from Renesas, sensors from Denso) or Korea‚Äôs advanced battery materials and displays. Under an FTA, BYD could import high-tech parts from Japanese and Korean suppliers tariff-free and likely faster. That means BYD‚Äôs cars can benefit from top-notch components at lower cost. Similarly, BYD could export its own components to partners in those countries. Perhaps Japanese automakers might buy BYD‚Äôs affordable batteries (BYD‚Äôs blade battery tech is world-class), or Korean firms could source BYD‚Äôs EV semiconductors or motors. With fewer trade frictions, a more efficient regional EV supply chain forms, and BYD can slot right into it as both supplier and assembler.

We‚Äôre already seeing hints of such collaboration. All three governments have talked about strengthening supply chain cooperation in high-tech sectors as part of improving trilateral trade ties‚Äã. For example, South Korea and Japan want reliable access to China‚Äôs rare earths and battery materials, while China wants chips from Japan/Korea‚Äã. EVs benefit directly from this kind of exchange: BYD needs advanced chips (which Japan/Korea excel at), and Japanese/Korean automakers need battery tech (which BYD offers). A freer trade environment makes these exchanges smoother and less politically fraught.

One likely focus area is EV battery supply chains. Batteries often have materials crisscrossing borders (lithium processed in China, cells made in Korea, etc.). With an FTA, these materials and parts could move across China, Japan, and Korea with minimal hassle, lowering the cost to build each battery pack. BYD‚Äôs cars ‚Äì and also its battery sales to other OEMs ‚Äì would get a cost edge from that. In a sense, the FTA could encourage a regional EV ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù where each country specializes a bit (China mass-produces, Japan provides precision components, Korea contributes tech and refinement) to collectively take on Western competitors. BYD, given its scale and vertical integration, would be in a prime spot to orchestrate and benefit from this synergy.

Tech Partnerships & Investments: BYD + Japan/Korea = üíï

Perhaps the most exciting (and underrated) benefit: a free trade deal would likely foster more tech collaboration and cross-investment between companies in China, Japan, and Korea ‚Äì which could hugely aid BYD. Free trade isn‚Äôt just about goods; it builds trust and business ties. And when borders are more open, big players tend to team up rather than reinvent the wheel.

BYD‚Äôs already got notable friends in Japan/Korea. Case in point: Toyota. The Japanese giant struck a joint venture with BYD to co-develop electric cars, pooling their R&D talent. Engineers from both companies are literally working under one roof to ‚Äúdevelop BEVs that are superior in performance... by merging the two companies‚Äô strengths,‚Äù as the JV‚Äôs CEO put it‚Äã. This kind of partnership was once unthinkable ‚Äì a top Japanese automaker relying on a Chinese firm‚Äôs EV tech ‚Äì but BYD‚Äôs expertise (especially in batteries) made it happen. An FTA would likely encourage more partnerships like Toyota-BYD, by assuring Japanese and Korean firms that cooperation with Chinese companies is a safe, long-term bet (no sudden trade wars to wreck the venture). We could envision, say, Honda or Nissan collaborating with BYD on battery supply, or Korean firms like Samsung expanding their investment in BYD.

Speaking of Samsung ‚Äì they actually invested $450 million in BYD a few years back‚Äã, taking a small stake to cooperate on electric car chips and batteries. That‚Äôs a Korean electronics titan effectively betting on BYD‚Äôs auto future. Similarly, there are reports of other tech exchanges (for example, rumors that BYD might supply batteries to certain Japanese EV projects, etc.). If China/Japan/Korea enter a free trade framework, it lowers the political risk of such deals and likely removes caps or hassles on cross-border investments. BYD could more easily attract capital or partnerships from say, a SoftBank or a Hyundai Mobis, who might want exposure to its EV battery business or its fast-growing EV lineup.

For BYD, more collaboration means faster innovation and market penetration. Partnering with established Japanese and Korean players can help BYD improve its tech (imagine BYD using Sony sensors or Samsung displays in its cars seamlessly) and also gain local market insights. It‚Äôs a two-way street: those partners get BYD‚Äôs cost-efficient tech, and BYD gains credibility and technical refinement. A trade deal acting as a green light for such tie-ups is a big strategic win for BYD‚Äôs long-term growth. As a cherry on top, freer investment flows might even allow BYD to set up joint factories or R&D centers in Japan/Korea down the line, further ingraining them in those markets (and creating jobs there, which governments love).

The Long-Term Growth Boost

Tie it all together, and BYD stands to gain on multiple fronts: more sales opportunities, lower costs, stronger tech, and bigger allies. In a business as globally competitive as electric vehicles, those advantages can be game-changing. BYD is already the world‚Äôs largest EV maker by volume, and it‚Äôs hungry for global market share. A China-Korea-Japan FTA would effectively hand BYD a ‚Äúhome field‚Äù advantage across East Asia ‚Äì a region with huge car markets and tech resources. It‚Äôs no surprise analysts are buzzing about East Asian economic cooperation. These three countries combined are an economic juggernaut (quarter of global GDP) with massive auto industry clout‚Äã.

If they tear down trade barriers among themselves, companies like BYD that can integrate across borders will be in pole position.

From an investor‚Äôs perspective, this kind of free trade pact would make the bull case for BYD‚Äôs international expansion even stronger. It de-risks their Asia expansion and could add a few percentage points to profit margins on each car sold in Japan/Korea (thanks to tariff removal and supply chain efficiencies). It also signals that major governments in the region are supportive of EV industry growth via cooperation, not protectionism ‚Äì which bodes well for BYD not getting shut out. Remember, a rising tide lifts all boats: BYD‚Äôs success in Japan and Korea could also positively pressure local rivals to step up, expanding the overall EV market pie (which BYD gets a slice of).",2025-04-03 12:15:28,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqgunf/why_a_chinakoreajapan_free_trade_deal_would_be_a/

if you still think elon is running tesla, you're delusional. tesla makes money from cars, not some fantasy robotaxis or humanoid robots that are nowhere near real. the guy is too distracted trying to be a political influencer instead of fixing his sinking brand.

tesla in 2022 could sell any car they make  at any price. now? they're slashing prices and still struggling. cybertruck owners have to worry about their cars getting vandalized because the brand is toxic. it's not just the usa‚Äîhe's managed to turn europe and the uk against tesla too. if china weren‚Äôt so cut off, he‚Äôd probably have tanked that market as well.

there are plenty of smart people who could run tesla better, but elon has the board in his pocket, so there's no real accountability

1jps3gk,Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs,"(Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

Rivian produced 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 13,980 a year ago. It reaffirmed its annual deliveries forecast.

News: [Trump Weighing Tariff Options As Rose Garden Event Nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/trump-weighing-tariff-options-as-rose-garden-event-nears)

# Trump speaks at the Rose Garden at 4PM EST today- be on the lookout for incremental headlines or anything that is passed on from his admin.

[**FXI (China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d), [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d), [**PDD (Pinduoduo)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PDD&p=d), [**JD (JD.com)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JD&p=d) \- China is restricting domestic companies from investing in the U.S. This is significant news in that it's a ""warning shot across the bow"" from China; they're slowly starting to escalate in response to Trump's potential tariffs coming out later today. A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,

[**SPY (S&P 500 ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d), [**QQQ (Invesco QQQ)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d), VXX, etc. - President Trump is set to unveil new tariffs today but is still finalizing details. Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).

No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain. Otherwise, business continues as usual and they don't benefit. .",2025-04-02 13:15:56,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpoamx/interesting_stocks_today_042/
1jpo69r,"Tesla reports 336,000 vehicle deliveries in first quarter","Tesla¬†reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company‚Äôs stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000
* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000

Investors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla‚Äôs investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi¬†on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.

In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company‚Äôs shareholder communications.

Tesla doesn‚Äôt break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454¬†of its most popular¬†Model 3 and Model Y cars¬†and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.

The company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.

During the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.

CEO Elon Musk recently said during an¬†all-hands¬†session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the ‚Äúbest-selling car on Earth again this year.‚Äù¬†

But Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of¬†protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk‚Äôs political rhetoric and his work as part of¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs¬†second administration.

After spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he‚Äôs slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.

Musk, the world‚Äôs wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February‚Äôs elections. Tesla‚Äôs business on the continent is struggling.

Across 15 European countries, Tesla‚Äôs market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla‚Äôs market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.

Tesla shares¬†sank 36%¬†in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.

1jpicww,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Hidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",2025-04-02 06:47:15,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/

Two of the three major U.S. stock indexes just wrapped up their worst quarter in well over two years. The third barely avoided the same fate.

The S&P 500 dropped more than 4.5% for the first quarter of 2025 as of Monday‚Äôs close, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 10.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average settled 1.3% lower and recorded its first back-to-back monthly loss since October 2023.

The declines on all three indexes come days before President Donald Trump is set to unveil a new slate of wide-ranging tariffs, extending ongoing trade policy turmoil that has kept investors guessing for months.

The broad-based S&P 500 fell briefly into correction territory Monday, meaning a 10% slide from its last high. The index regained some ground late in the day, but not enough to dodge its worst monthly percentage drop since December 2022.

The index‚Äôs first-quarter stumbles ended a streak of five straight winning quarters, while the Nasdaq wiped out more than half of last year‚Äôs gains over the last three months. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta, known on Wall Street as the ‚Äúmagnificent 7,‚Äù have lost more than $2 trillion in market value collectively since the start of the year.

The last time U.S. markets stumbled as badly was in the middle of 2022 after Russia‚Äôs late-February invasion of Ukraine, shocking the global economy as Western nations hit Moscow with severe sanctions and commodities like oil and grains shot up in price.",2025-03-31 23:45:17,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1joht47/stocks_close_out_their_worst_quarter_since_2022/
1jo91nk,Elon Musk says backlash against his DOGE government cuts is hurting Tesla stock,"Tesla¬†CEO Elon Musk said Sunday that his involvement in the Trump administration could be hurting the automaker‚Äôs stock price.

Speaking at a town hall event in Wisconsin, Musk said his role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency ‚Äî which is pushing for widespread government job cuts ‚Äî is creating backlash against his electric car company and hurting the stock.

‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôre trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ... stop doing this,‚Äù Musk said, according to¬†Bloomberg News. ‚ÄúMy Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it‚Äôs a big deal.‚Äù

Shares of Tesla entered Monday already down more than 34% year to date, and the stock has been cut nearly in half from its peak in December. Shares were down an additional 6% in premarket trading Monday.

The drop for the stock could be a ‚Äúbuying opportunity‚Äù for the long term, said Musk, who was in Wisconsin ahead of a state supreme court election there. Musk has campaigned for the conservative candidate and¬†spent more than $12 million¬†on the race, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at Sunday‚Äôs rally for signing a petition against ‚Äúactivist judges.‚Äù

The slumping stock isn‚Äôt the only sign of public anger with Musk for his political work.¬†Protesters¬†demonstrated at Tesla dealerships over the weekend, and there have been reports of vandalism against vehicles and dealers across the country.

Musk‚Äôs role in politics is not limited to DOGE. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024 and has been a regular presence at the White House since the new administration took over in January. He also regularly comments on many different political topics on X, the social media company he owns.

The CEO‚Äôs rising political profile comes amid signs that Tesla‚Äôs core business is slowing. The automaker‚Äôs vehicle¬†deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary data has shown that¬†sales are down again¬†early this year, especially in Europe. In a note to clients Sunday, investment firm Stifel¬†trimmed its price target¬†on the stock and lowered its sales projections for Tesla.

Musk‚Äôs political dealings may not be the only reason for Tesla‚Äôs struggles. Other¬†U.S. auto stocks¬†have also labored in recent weeks, partly because of threats of higher tariffs on imported goods into the U.S. and retaliation from overseas trading partners, adding uncertainty to an industry whose supply chains are tightly woven among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

‚ÄúShares of electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 5.3% to $249.6 in premarket trading on Monday, following a downgrade from Stifel.

The brokerage cut its price target on Tesla stock from $474 to $455 and significantly lowered its full-year 2025 delivery forecast from 17% growth to just 4%.

Stifel cited the rollout of the new Model Y (Juniper) and growing negative sentiment toward CEO Elon Musk as key factors impacting the company‚Äôs outlook.‚Äù

1jo2ogp,Interesting Stocks Today (03/31),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [US Stock Futures Tumble Ahead Of New Trump Tariffs: Markets Wrap ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/us-stock-futures-tumble-ahead-of-new-trump-tariffs-markets-wrap)

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) , larger tech stocks - ""Liberation day"" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). 

Overall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). 

**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. 

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d) \- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term.

1jnvqnv,Why is Tesla Worth Anything?,"Chinese BYD company has just outsold Tesla worldwide and is taking over European markets.

Why don't investors price this in?

We say NVDA crashing after deepseek came out. BYD is way more dangerous to Tesla than Deepseek is to Open AI.

BYD had great cars for as low as $10,000. Without tarrifs, BYD would come to the US and completely wipe Tesla out.

I suppose this can be delayed through tarrifs but long term, it looks like Tesla is cooked.

BYD sells cars twice as good for half the price.

So why is Tesla stock worth so much if BYD is beating it all over the world and if tarrifs were removed, BYD would wipe Tesla out in the US as well.",2025-03-31 05:06:43,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jnvqnv/why_is_tesla_worth_anything/
1jngg3e,Challenging the Noise: A Closer Look at Tesla's Q1 Projections,"As we have all seen, there are a ton of headlines about Tesla's (TSLA) declining sales numbers, and it's honestly a bit overwhelming. Here's a quick breakdown of what I gathered:

* Europe sales are reportedly down by 45%
* China sales have decreased by either 49% or 29%
* Australia sales are down by 65.5%

\^\^ keep in mind there are a ton of articles and headlines on this, I picked from a few \^\^

With all these headlines, it's tough to figure out what timeframes they're talking about. Is it one day, one week, three months? Who knows?

Amidst all this noise, I decided to dig deeper into what we should actually expect. While analysts' projections aren't great, they don't seem as grim as the headlines suggest.

**Global Tesla Sales (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 386,810 units
* **2025 Initial Projections**: 412,000 units (median of 398K-426K range, which would've been a 6.5% increase)
* **2025 Current Projections**: 377,000 units (a 2.5% decrease from Q1 2024)
* **Projection Change**: Initial to current projections dropped by 8.5%

**USA Sales Breakdown (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 140,187 vehicles
* **2025 Current Projection**: 138,867 vehicles
* **Change**: Only a 0.9% decrease in the US market

These numbers don't look great, especially for a company like Tesla that's all about growth. But we're still talking about single-digit declines quarter-over-quarter, assuming the analysts are somewhat correct.

I wanted to understand what the Q1 report might reveal because, going by the headlines, it seemed like it would be terrible. But after digging in, it doesn't seem as bad as it feels. Is it just me?

What do you all think? Could the market react less harshly on Q1 review day than the news is making it out to be?",2025-03-30 16:37:34,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jngg3e/challenging_the_noise_a_closer_look_at_teslas_q1/
1jlvzdl,TSLA - Premliminary Tesla registration numbers from March 2025 in Europe.,"Someone (in¬†[r/RealTesla](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/)) posted a table of preliminary registration numbers for a few European countries. In some countries like Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands, they are down by aprox 60-70% in March 2025 compared to last year  (March 2024), even after Model Y changeover has finished.

In Norway, Tesla is once again the best seller, but it's still down by around 20% from March 2024, and the Q1 total is down around 30%.

There is currently no supply shortage, since you can order a new Model Y Juniper and get delivery almost the same day. The source for the numbers were taken from this website:¬†[https://eu-evs.com/](https://eu-evs.com/)

One country had an increase in sales 25% (Spain).

1jkxq24,Elon Musk Is One of the Few Winners From Trump Auto Tariffs,"> Donald Trump‚Äôs planned tariffs on auto imports will hurt carmakers around the world and push up prices for US consumers. Among the many losers, one winner stands out: Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla Inc.

1jko4ew,"Tesla shares drop on plunging European sales, concerns about Trump's tariffs","Tesla shares fell almost 6% on Wednesday as data from Europe showed slowing sales last month, and investors grew increasingly concerned about President Donald Trump‚Äôs plan for tariffs.

The European Automobile Manufacturers‚Äô Association (ACEA) revealed on Tuesday that Tesla saw a 40% year-over-year drop in new vehicle registrations in Europe in February, while overall battery electric vehicle sales were up 26%.

Meanwhile, the White House said on Wednesday that President Trump will announce new tariffs on auto imports in the afternoon. The president has hyped April 2 as ‚Äúliberation day‚Äù and ‚Äúthe big one‚Äù for rolling out his plan to impose heavy tariffs on foreign trading partners, but Trump hinted earlier this week that auto tariffs could arrive sooner.

Movements of this magnitude have become commonplace for Tesla‚Äôs stock. On 14 separate days this year, Tesla shares have gained or lost at least 5%. Wednesday‚Äôs selloff, alongside a 2% drop in the Nasdaq, followed a five-day rally that included a 12% jump on Monday.

The trend for the year has been downward, particularly since President Trump began his second term in January, and brought Tesla CEO Elon Musk with him to the White House. Tesla shares are down 36% since Inauguration Day, after falling 28% in February, the steepest drop for any month since December 2022.

Following the ACEA report on Tuesday, RBC analysts wrote in a note that the February numbers only represented a drop of about 11,000 Tesla vehicle registrations in Europe, and emphasized that data for the month ‚Äúmight not be indicative of true demand.‚Äù

New car buyers in Europe, the analysts said, ‚Äúcould be holding out for the Model Y refresh,‚Äù or a ‚Äúnew affordable model,‚Äù which they expect in the second half of the year.

Tesla is set to fully ramp up production of the redesigned version of its Model Y SUV next month. The company implemented partial production shutdowns at certain factories earlier this year to upgrade Model Y manufacturing lines.

Some prospective EV buyers have been turned off of late by Musk‚Äôs political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, where he‚Äôs leading an effort to slash federal government spending, cut the federal workforce, and has said he wants to privatize many services, including social security.

William Blair analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday that, ‚Äúpushback from Musk‚Äôs foray into politics‚Äù has led to ‚Äúbrand damage and even vandalism,‚Äù for Tesla at a time when the company‚Äôs supply has been impacted by its Model Y changeover, and ‚ÄúChinese competition continues to heat up.‚Äù

Still, the firm maintained its buy recommendation on Tesla‚Äôs stock, pointing to growth in the company‚Äôs energy storage business, and its prospects in driverless ride hailing. Musk has promised that Tesla will kick off a robotaxi service in Austin in June. The company has yet to begin production of its dedicated robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab.

Alphabet‚Äôs Waymo is already operating a commercial robotaxi service in Austin and other markets. And in China, several automakers are now offering an equivalent to Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving Supervised ‚Äî a premium, partially automated driving system ‚Äî as standard options rather than a paid service.

In China this week, Tesla renamed its FSD system ‚ÄúIntelligent Assisted Driving,‚Äù according to CNEVPost, after previously branding it as ‚ÄúFull Self-driving Capability.‚Äù Tesla‚Äôs system in all markets still requires a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

1jkg3ak,Stop pretending you know the market,"I've been investing for a couple of years. My longs are looking great, even with the most recent dips. Got confident last November and decided to learn about trading and started doing it with small money. Five months later with some losses and some gains, and my conclusion is pretty straightforward: just don't trade. The only thing you are guaranteed to lose and never get back: hours of your life.

Especially with Trump and the current administration, the average trader will never be able to read the market with enough confidence to know what they are doing. If you are trading, and you're not inside the market itselft, you're a gambler, accept that description. Hell, you might even have an addition. 
I'm going back to DCA and holding, I don't even want to look at this shit weekly, life shouldn't be about red and green blocks, ew. 
That's my five cents, take it or leave it.

Edit: if you're a genius and you're making millions out of your Tesla puts, don't listen to me of course, keep being a genius.

News:¬†[Trump Says Tariffs Coming In April Will Probably Be More Lenient Than Reciprocal](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/26/trump-says-tariffs-coming-in-april-will-probably-be-more-lenient-than-reciprocal.html)

[**GME (GameStop)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME&p=d)¬†**-**¬†Reported earnings, EPS of $0.29 vs $0.08 expected. EPS beat estimates, and the company announced it would integrate Bitcoin into its treasury reserve. This confirms prior speculation tied to Ryan Cohen‚Äôs meeting with Strategy‚Äôs chairman.¬†**This is a massive catalyst**¬†solely based on the fact that if GME buys enough of the CC, we may see it trade at a premium the same way as MSTR does. (MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.

**Related Tickers:**¬†MSTR, COIN

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada‚Äôs EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).

[**DLTR (Dollar Tree)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DLTR&p=d)**-**¬†DLTR will divest its Family Dollar segment for \~$1B to Brigade Capital and Macellum, a massive markdown from the $9B it paid in 2015. The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.

Seen a minor selloff in NVDA of roughly $2, interested to see if we sell off more at the open. China‚Äôs energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024. More regulation or bans could further limit access to Chinese demand, other chipmakers, etc. This DOES seem targeted to have Chinese companies focus on

1jjvzui,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

1jjrhhe,Chinese EV giant BYD outpaces Tesla with annual sales of more than $100 billion,"Chinese automaker BYD reported annual revenue of 777 billion yuan ($107 billion) for 2024, leapfrogging U.S. rival Tesla as competition between the two electric vehicle rivals heats up.

In a filing published Monday, BYD posted a 29% increase in revenue from the previous year, bolstered by sales of its hybrid vehicles. This figure exceeded the $97.7 billion annual revenue reported by Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla.

Wang Chuanfu, chairman and president of BYD, hailed the firm‚Äôs ‚Äúrapid development‚Äù in 2024, noting the company became the first automaker globally to reach the milestone of rolling out 10 million new energy vehicles in November.

‚ÄúBYD has become an industry leader in every sector from batteries, electronics to new energy vehicles, breaking the dominance of foreign brands and reshaping the new landscape of the global market,‚Äù Wang said in a statement.

The filing comes shortly after BYD announced a new battery technology that it claims can charge EVs almost as quickly as it takes to fill a gasoline car.

The automaker said last week that it‚Äôs new so-called Super e-Platform will allow cars that use the technology to achieve 400 kilometers (roughly 249 miles) of range with just five minutes of charging. CNBC could not independently verify these claims.

Analysts hailed BYD‚Äôs new battery platform as ‚Äúout of this world‚Äù and suggested the development could lead to a profound change of behavior among EV owners.

Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD have rallied 46% year to date.

Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, have tumbled more than 31% so far this year, amid rising consumer boycotts and plummeting demand globally driven in part by Musk‚Äôs rise as a hard-line conservative political figure.

1jiqjct,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE),¬†[VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK),¬†[BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV),¬†[9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

This has resulted in a market bounce and overall means that markets will likely NOT be as impacted by tariffs as they were expecting. 

The tariff game Trump is playing reminds me of that scene from the office: ""You have no idea the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person! Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!"" -Michael Scott. 

Anyway back to the watchlist. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs‚Äîinterested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.

[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results. Q4 revenue of $54.7M (+80% YoY) and FY24 revenue of $228.0M (nearly 3x YoY).

Backlog reached $328.3M (+22% YoY), with **projected positive run-rate Adj. EBITDA by year-end**. Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return. Also watching RKLB on this. 

[**AZEK (The AZEK Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AZEK&p=d)\- James Hardie to acquire AZEK in a cash/stock deal valued at $8.75B (including debt). AZEK holders to receive $26.45 cash + 1.034 JHX shares, totaling \~$53/share (as of premarket prices)**.** These hybrid stock/cash acquisitions can fluctuate in price because of how the acquirer pays with their own stock. Typical M&A risks apply such as integration risk, housing market softness, FX exposure (James Hardie also trades in Australia IIRC), regulatory risk, etc.

#Trump‚Äôs Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants

###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won‚Äôt be easy.

> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti‚ÄìElon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.

> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies‚Äô cloud services‚Äîincluding servers, storage, and databases‚Äîciting uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.

> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,‚Äù says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford‚Äôs Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.

> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become ‚Äúmore technologically independent‚Äù and saying the status quo creates ‚Äúsecurity and reliability risks.‚Äù

> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks‚Äîwith some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.

> ‚ÄúWe have more demand from across Europe,‚Äù says Mathias N√∂bauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. ‚ÄúSome customers were very explicit,‚Äù N√∂bauer says. ‚ÄúEspecially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúIt's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans‚Äô perspective‚Äîthat the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,‚Äù says Joakim √ñhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. ‚ÄúThose are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.‚Äù

> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people‚Äôs rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, √ñhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.

> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company‚Äôs few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, it‚Äôs about values,‚Äù Cottlehuber says. ‚ÄúFor me, privacy is a right not a privilege.‚Äù Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. ‚ÄúThe best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers‚Äô privacy is respected and preserved,‚Äù Cottlehuber says.

> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always ‚Äúbeen a must,‚Äù but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. ‚ÄúSince the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,‚Äù Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to N√∂bauer‚Äôs Exoscale.

> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is ‚Äúnot accurate‚Äù that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. ‚ÄúOur customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,‚Äù Straight says. ‚ÄúAWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.‚Äù Staight says the membership of the PCLOB ‚Äúdoes not impact‚Äù the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has ‚Äúadditional safeguards for cloud content.‚Äù Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. ‚ÄúWe can certainly feel that something is going on,‚Äù Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has ‚Äúbeaten‚Äù the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. ‚ÄúThis is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,‚Äù he says.

> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small‚Äîat least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services‚Äîsuch as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing‚Äîfrom the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. ‚ÄúWhat happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,‚Äù he says.

> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon‚Äôs cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.

> ‚ÄúIf you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you‚Äôll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,‚Äù says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer ‚Äúsafe‚Äù for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can‚Äôt properly compete. ‚ÄúWe sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,‚Äù he says. However, that too could change.

> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. ‚ÄúThe dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,‚Äù Schaake says. ‚ÄúThe idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.‚Äù

1jijwnb,Tesla short thesis and the U.S. market (House of Cards) pending crash Part 2,"Hello Fellow Apes (I use this term affectionately‚Äîdon‚Äôt take it too seriously),

I want to start by saying a huge thank you for all the kind words, thoughtful comments, insightful DMs, and support following my previous post. Honestly‚Äîholy shit‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt expect that post to blow up the way it did.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla\_short\_thesis\_and\_the\_us\_market\_house\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/)

As of the time I‚Äôm writing this, Part 1 has pulled in some pretty insane numbers:

* 542,000 views
* 774 upvotes
* 356 comments
* 817 shares

Those are absolutely bonkers, and I‚Äôm genuinely grateful for the encouragement and engagement. I‚Äôve been a long-time lurker on this subreddit, learning quietly from many of you over the years. I never imagined that something I‚Äôd write would get this kind of traction. But some of the comments in that thread raised important questions and valid counterpoints‚Äîso I wanted to follow up with a deeper response.

Now, for those asking for charts, crayons, or simplified pictures‚Äîjust a heads-up: this sub doesn‚Äôt support image uploads. So if you're looking for visual aids, you‚Äôll need to do a bit of homework and look up the references and data I mention here. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth your time.

Also, there will be no TL;DR at the end of this post. If you‚Äôre someone who can‚Äôt‚Äîor won‚Äôt‚Äîread through a detailed explanation, then this probably isn‚Äôt for you. The economy, and the factors that influence how a stock moves, are complex. If you're not willing to engage with that complexity, you‚Äôre setting yourself up to get burned. So, with that said, let‚Äôs dive in.

This comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter.

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/)

Tesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information.

[https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024](https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024)

Now let's talk about sale of regulatory credits. These are *not actual cars sold*‚Äîthey're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn‚Äôt meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard‚Äîlike Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric. Then it sells them to other automakers who still rely on gas-powered cars. This is essentially free money for Tesla‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt cost them anything to generate these credits, but they can sell them for hundreds of millions of dollars.

As for interest income, this is money Tesla earns just for having cash in the bank or investments. Tesla holds billions in cash and short-term investments. Instead of letting it sit there, they invest it in safe, interest-earning instruments (like U.S. Treasury bonds or money market funds). This also include bitcoin. As interest rates rise, these earnings go up‚Äîso Tesla earns hundreds of millions per quarter just from letting their money sit and grow.

Remember what I said about bitcoin in the previous post? ""In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060) If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.""

If this number hold true, Tesla interest income from bitcoin will drop by 9.96%.

With that said, the saying that Tesla doesn't make money from car isn't true. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue‚Äîwhich includes income from vehicle sales and related services‚Äîtotaled approximately $18.8 billion. This figure represents about 73% of Tesla's total revenue of $25.7 billion for the same period. For the entire year of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue amounted to $72.5 billion, accounting for approximately 74% of the total annual revenue of $97.7 billion. Remember the stuff about regulator credit above? These percentages indicate that automotive sales remain the primary contributor to Tesla's revenue, both quarterly and annually. Tesla is still a car company at heart, and this was it moat.

You might not know this about me, but I used to be a hardcore Tesla fanboy. I invested in the company back when they were just producing the original Roadster. Over the years, I‚Äôve owned *every single product* Tesla has put out‚Äîincluding four of their vehicles.

Tesla‚Äôs sky-high valuation wasn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit was because the company was doing things no one else dared to. It was more than just an automaker; it was positioned as a tech and AI company, with aspirations in robotics and full self-driving. But even beyond that, Tesla was pioneering a completely new model of vertical integration.

It wasn‚Äôt just about selling electric cars. Tesla popularized EVs, achieved massive adoption rates, and built an entire ecosystem around the vehicle. They sold their own insurance, handled their own repairs, created and *standardized* their own charging port (which others later adopted), and developed the most expansive EV charging network in the world.

Elon Musk wasn‚Äôt just building a car company‚Äîhe was positioning Tesla to be the Rockefeller of the 21st-century automotive industry. Just like how Rockefeller controlled the oil pipeline from extraction to distribution, Tesla was aiming to control everything:

* Design and manufacturing of the vehicles
* Repair and servicing (only Tesla could repair a Tesla)
* Insurance and financing
* And the ‚Äúgas stations‚Äù of the future‚Äîtheir Supercharger network

It was a brilliant playbook, and it echoed what made Sony so dominant in the 1990s: Sony owned the formats. Whether it was CDs, MiniDiscs, Blu-ray, or the Walkman headphone jack, Sony created the platforms and *collected royalties* when others used them.

Had Tesla stayed on that course‚Äîdoubling down on ecosystem control and technological dominance‚Äîthey truly had a shot at owning the entire EV industry. But somewhere along the way, they pivoted, and that vision started to drift.

I was a fanboy of Tesla, and I sold everything in November. I also started shorting Spy, but hopefully, I have time to talk about the economy in this post.

What truly broke the long-term vision for Tesla, in my eyes, was the company‚Äôs decision to step back from its charging station expansion‚Äîthe very dream of becoming the next-generation energy empire, replacing Shell, Chevron, Mobil, and essentially every gas station in the world.

In late April 2024, Tesla made a dramatic internal shift by disbanding its entire Supercharger team, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. This wasn‚Äôt a small reorganization‚Äîit was a major strategic reversal. The move immediately sparked concern about the future of Tesla‚Äôs vast charging infrastructure, which had once been one of its most significant competitive advantages.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\_Supercharger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Supercharger)

In response, Elon Musk stated that Tesla would still grow its Supercharger network‚Äîbut at a much slower pace. The new focus would be on maintaining 100% uptime and expanding existing sites, rather than continuing the rapid rollout of new stations across the country and around the world. This change came as part of broader company-wide layoffs and a growing strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and robotics.

[https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/)

For Tesla‚Äôs automotive partners‚Äîlike Ford, GM, and Rivian, who had recently committed to adopting Tesla‚Äôs NACS charging standard‚Äîthis sudden shift caused confusion and uncertainty. They had signed on with the expectation that Tesla would continue leading the way in EV infrastructure. Now, that future looked far less clear.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/)

As a Tesla owner in California, where EV adoption is highest, I‚Äôve already started to see the consequences firsthand. Fewer new charging stations are being built, and the reliability of existing ones is noticeably declining. Increasingly, I encounter broken or malfunctioning Superchargers‚Äîsomething that used to be rare. In some locations, the charging speeds are significantly slower than they used to be‚Äîsometimes even half as fast.

On top of that, Tesla has introduced energy usage-based time rates, and the cost of charging has surged. What used to be a convenient and cost-effective option now feels like a premium-priced service. Three years ago, I used Superchargers without thinking twice. Today, I charge almost exclusively at home‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs five to eight times cheaper. Furthermore, you have to think about the high cost of housing and the majority of people renting or living in an apartment. They would have all had to use the Tesla charging stations for every EV car. Think about this implication!

**The bigger picture here is that Elon Musk had the chance to be a modern-day Rockefeller. He was on track to own the entire energy pipeline for electric vehicles: manufacturing the cars, selling the insurance, controlling the repairs, and operating the ‚Äúgas stations‚Äù of the EV era through the Supercharger network.**

But that opportunity has slipped away. The dream of Tesla owning the entire EV ecosystem‚Äîend to end‚Äîhas fractured. And it‚Äôs hard not to see this as a major strategic misstep.

u/Qc4281 ""I believe the Bulls are putting all of their hope in robotaxis and regardless of Q1, June will be the real test of how much support Tesla continues to have.""

It‚Äôs time to face a hard truth: Tesla is no longer on the cutting edge of robotaxi technology. As of 2025, the undisputed leader in autonomous ride-hailing is Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google‚Äôs parent company).

Waymo operates at SAE Level 4 autonomy, meaning their vehicles can drive themselves without any human inside, in specific geofenced areas. This isn‚Äôt a prototype‚Äîit‚Äôs real, operational, and public.

Their Waymo One robotaxi service is live in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where anyone can hail a fully driverless car‚Äîno safety driver, no steering wheel input, no human control required. Riders are using it every day like a regular Uber or Lyft.

In contrast, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) is still classified as Level 2 autonomy. That means the system can assist with steering, acceleration, and braking, but the driver must be fully alert and ready to take over at all times. Tesla has no regulatory approval to operate a robotaxi fleet, and no Tesla on the road today can legally drive itself.

Waymo uses a sophisticated sensor fusion approach:

* Lidar for detailed 3D mapping
* Radar for object detection in poor visibility
* High-definition maps to understand complex city layouts

Tesla, by contrast, has removed radar and relies exclusively on cameras and neural networks, a vision-only system. While Tesla claims this mimics human driving, it‚Äôs also less reliable in poor lighting, bad weather, or unpredictable road scenarios. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles on public roads and released a detailed 2023 safety report showing zero major injuries or fatalities across millions of fully autonomous rides.

Elon Musk has been promising Level 4 or even Level 5 autonomy ‚Äúnext year‚Äù since 2016‚Äînearly a decade of delays. As of today, FSD Beta still requires constant supervision. Tesla has not submitted its system to any regulatory body (e.g., DMV or NHTSA) for approval as an autonomous driving platform. No Tesla vehicle qualifies as a robotaxi, and none are legally allowed to operate as such

Tesla can't jump straight to Level 4. It first needs to prove Level 3, where the car can drive itself under limited conditions without driver input‚Äîbut even that milestone has not been reached. It‚Äôs based more on hope and hype than actual technical progress or regulatory reality. Tesla has a powerful brand, and Elon‚Äôs ambitious promises get attention‚Äîbut when it comes to real-world robotaxi deployment, Waymo is years ahead.

Now we can talk about the robot. Boston Dynamics and Tesla‚Äôs Optimus are both developing humanoid robots. Boston Dynamic Has been developing humanoid and quadruped robots for **over a decade**. Their humanoid robot, Atlas, can run, jump, do parkour, backflips, and handle complex terrain. Their quadruped robot, Spot, is already being used in real industrial environments‚Äîconstruction sites, factories, even police and research teams.

Tesla first unveiled Optimus in 2021as a concept, with actual development starting in 2022. Still in early prototype stages‚ÄîTesla has shown it walking, lifting objects, and folding clothes, but it‚Äôs not yet capable of dynamic movement like Atlas. As of 2025, it‚Äôs still being tested internally and isn‚Äôt commercially deployed.

Boston Dynamics is years ahead in terms of real-world functionality.

I think I‚Äôve looked into this deeply enough to respond to the common claim that ‚ÄúTesla is more than just a car company.‚Äù The truth is, Tesla *was* more than just a car company. It had a bold vision‚Äîrevolutionizing energy, transportation, and robotics all at once.

But that vision has faded.

Today, Tesla has lost much of its momentum under Elon Musk‚Äôs shifting priorities. Right now, it's essentially an overvalued car company that‚Äôs trying to break into the robotaxi and robotics space‚Äîfields where it's already years, if not a decade, behind the actual industry leaders.

The ambition is still there‚Äîbut the execution no longer matches the hype.

Now, this isn't to say that Tesla will be going down in the next months or two. I noticed many of the people who are reading the previous post didn't understand what I was talking about when I was talking about LPSY. Specifically, I was referring to the Wyckoff distribution schematic phase c-d LPSY. Phase C is the test. The ‚ÄòTest‚Äô serves the same but opposite function as the ‚ÄòSpring‚Äô in the accumulation phase: the bull trap before the downtrend. While this level does get broken, it doesn‚Äôt change the picture of the cycle. Phase D is the effect. Phase D in this distribution phase is a mirror image of Phase D in the accumulation cycle. There is a considerable surge in volume and volatility, comprising one or more Last Point of Supply (LPSY) points. A Sign of Weakness (SOW) level happens, the final indication that the bears will soon take center stage. You have to open up tradingview or similar program to draw this, but it looks like Tesla is currently in that phase.

[https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/)

The LPSY (Last Point of Supply) is a critical stage in the Wyckoff distribution schematic where rallies begin to fail, unable to reach previous highs. During this phase, we typically expect to see a short-term rally, but it‚Äôs often weak and unsustainable. Volume behavior becomes a major red flag‚Äîbuying volume dries up on the way up, while selling volume increases during pullbacks. This pattern suggests that institutions have already completed their distribution, leaving retail traders to buy the dip, unaware that the ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù has exited. As a result, the stock becomes highly vulnerable to a sharp decline.

In Tesla‚Äôs case, these signs are already becoming visible. We‚Äôre seeing a pattern of lower highs, indicating that each rebound is losing strength. Key support levels are eroding, and momentum is fading, even in response to what would typically be considered ‚Äúgood news.‚Äù At the same time, narrative fatigue is setting in‚Äîdelays in the robotaxi rollout, slowing delivery growth, ongoing price cuts, and Tesla‚Äôs recent pullback from expanding its Supercharger network have all contributed to weakening sentiment. All of this points to Tesla potentially being in its LPSY phase, teetering on the edge of a deeper markdown.

One thing we often overlook when talking about Tesla is its status as a luxury brand, which brings us back to the broader conversation about the economy. Before I go any further, I want to be clear: I‚Äôm praying that I‚Äôm wrong. I don‚Äôt *want* the economy to crash. But I‚Äôve lived through a recession before‚Äîand I remember it vividly.

Back in 2008, I watched family and friends lose their businesses, homes, jobs, savings‚Äîand in some cases, even loved ones. The pain was real. And what made it worse was knowing that much of it happened while our government and institutions downplayed the risks or outright lied to the public. That experience has shaped the way I look at economic data today.

Right now, I believe we're entering a recession‚Äîor at the very least, staring down a serious economic slowdown. I'm not writing this to tell you to sell all your stocks or panic. I‚Äôm sharing this because I hope you‚Äôll take a step back, assess your risks, and plan accordingly.

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity that is widespread and lasts for more than a few months. It typically shows up in multiple indicators: GDP, personal income, employment, industrial production, and retail sales. There's also a more technical (but less comprehensive) definition: two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the earliest warning signs appeared in November 2007, which the NBER later marked as the official start of the recession. At that time, major financial institutions began reporting huge losses on mortgage-backed securities, job growth slowed, consumer confidence dropped, and the stock market‚Äîwhich had peaked in October 2007‚Äîbegan to decline. Subprime lenders were collapsing, and credit was tightening across the board.

By mid-2008, the crisis accelerated: Bear Stearns collapsed in March, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. Housing prices plummeted, unemployment surged, and the economy spiraled. If you had exited the market in November 2007, you would not have seen the S&P 500 return to the same level until May 2011. That‚Äôs 3.5 years of waiting‚Äîand that's assuming you had the ability to hold through it all. This matters because knowing when to cut losses can save years of financial recovery, unless you're okay with sitting on those losses for the long haul.

I still remember watching Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, downplay the risks in the housing market and broader economy. Despite clear signs of overheating in credit and housing, he failed to act‚Äîignoring warnings from economists, regulators, and data. That experience is why I don‚Äôt place my faith in Jerome Powell or any official narrative. I trust only the numbers.

Looking ahead, the week of March 24‚Äì30 will give us key economic data. On Wednesday, we‚Äôll get the Durable Goods Orders report. The forecast is -0.7%, compared to last month‚Äôs +3.1%. If it comes in even lower, that‚Äôs significant‚Äîbecause durable goods (like cars, appliances, aircraft, and machinery) are only purchased when businesses and consumers feel confident. A steep drop in this number is a classic early warning sign of a recession. However, durable goods alone don‚Äôt tell the full story‚Äîit needs to be paired with rising unemployment, falling retail sales, and declining industrial production to form a full recessionary picture.

On Thursday, we‚Äôll see the GDP growth rate (QoQ). It was 3.0% in September and 3.1% in December. The projection now is 2.3%. If it misses expectations and drops even lower, we may not officially ‚Äúring the recession bell‚Äù just yet‚Äîbut June‚Äôs data will become pivotal. That's when things may start to shift into ""oh-shit"" mode.

Then on Friday, we‚Äôll get personal income and personal spending figures. These are crucial. If both decline, that‚Äôs another strong recession signal. Personal spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP, and if consumers stop spending, the economy slows‚Äîsimple as that. Personal income tells us how much financial cushion people have. When both metrics go down, it shows growing financial stress among households.

For the week of March 31‚ÄìApril 6, we‚Äôll get more insight with ISM Services PMI on Thursday, and then non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate on Friday. Forecasts haven‚Äôt been released yet, but if these numbers also disappoint‚Äîespecially in combination with all the metrics above‚Äîwe‚Äôll be staring at a textbook recession setup. These are the early signs, and I‚Äôm laying them out not to scare you, but to prepare you.

You may think I‚Äôm being overly cautious, and I could absolutely be wrong. And honestly‚ÄîI hope I am. But the question you have to ask yourself is: Are you willing to risk losing 50% of your savings just to see if I‚Äôm wrong?

Looking back at 2008, throughout most of 2007 and early 2008, the Bush administration repeatedly said the economy was ‚Äúfundamentally sound,‚Äù even as the housing and credit markets collapsed beneath them. In January 2008, President Bush acknowledged ‚Äúeconomic challenges‚Äù but still refused to call it a recession. And by the time the government acted decisively, it was already too late for millions of families.

This isn‚Äôt about being Republican or Democrat. It‚Äôs about making sure the words our officials say line up with what the numbers are telling us. If they don‚Äôt‚Äîwe need to learn from history and not fall into the same trap. We can‚Äôt afford to get scammed into losing our life savings again.

Let‚Äôs circle back to the topic of Tesla as a luxury brand‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs an important lens to view its current position through. Do you remember what happened during the 2008 financial crisis? Both automobile sales and luxury goods took a massive hit. Consumers cut back sharply on big-ticket purchases, and the luxury sector‚Äîcars, fashion, jewelry, travel‚Äîwas no exception.

If you haven‚Äôt already, take a look at LVMH, the world‚Äôs largest luxury conglomerate. Its stock has dropped significantly, reflecting weakening demand for high-end consumer goods. This is a telling sign. Now ask yourself‚Äîwhat about Airbnb (ABNB)? Another brand that, while not traditionally ‚Äúluxury,‚Äù thrives on discretionary income and consumer confidence. It‚Äôs also seeing a decline, which suggests people are pulling back on travel and experiences‚Äîanother luxury-like behavior.

Then there‚Äôs the VIX, the so-called ‚Äúfear index‚Äù that tracks market volatility. If you examine the chart, you‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs starting to resemble the early stages of 2008‚Äîwith rising spikes and volatility building quietly under the surface.

Some may argue that it also looks like 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a global economic shutdown. But the key difference is that in 2020, the whole world was impacted simultaneously‚Äîthe pandemic was a shared crisis that brought coordinated government responses, massive stimulus, and a V-shaped recovery.

This time is different. What we‚Äôre seeing now is primarily an American problem‚Äîrooted in sticky inflation, rising consumer debt, eroding household savings, and waning confidence in domestic institutions and policy. Other countries aren't yet showing the same systemic stress.

So when we talk about Tesla, or any luxury-adjacent brand, we have to recognize that luxury spending is one of the first things to be cut when consumers feel insecure. And the signs‚Äîfrom LVMH to ABNB to the VIX‚Äîare stacking up. This isn‚Äôt fear-mongering. It‚Äôs pattern recognition.

Lastly‚Äîand I want to emphasize this‚ÄîI'm not saying the sky is falling, nor am I predicting that the stock market is going to crash tomorrow. In fact, I actually believe the market may move upward in the short term due to momentum, technicals, or temporary optimism.

However, looking beyond the next few weeks, I believe the economic data over the next six months will begin to confirm what many of us already feel: that a recession is likely on the horizon. In particular, I think the next three months will be the most revealing. The trends we see in that window‚Äîwhether in job growth, consumer spending, durable goods, or inflation‚Äîwill be the ‚Äútell‚Äù that it's time for investors to start protecting their assets and reassessing their positions.

You don't need to sell everything. But you do need to have a plan. Because once the data becomes undeniable, the window to exit cleanly and safely may close fast.

Thank you for taking the time to read my posts. I had planned to dive into other topics, but honestly, there‚Äôs so much unfolding right now that it‚Äôs hard to keep it all focused. I genuinely feel for those who are still holding on, caught in the sunken cost fallacy, hoping things will bounce back simply because they‚Äôve already lost so much.

Just remember: losing less is always better than losing more. Sometimes survival in the market isn‚Äôt about timing the top or the bottom‚Äîit‚Äôs about knowing when to step aside and preserve what you have.

1jheaxd,Tesla short thesis and the U.S. market (House of Cards) pending crash,"Hello Fellow Apes (I use this term affectionately‚Äîdon‚Äôt take it too seriously),

I‚Äôve been seeing a flood of posts about Tesla lately, and I‚Äôll admit‚ÄîI‚Äôm feeling the FOMO. But instead of just jumping in impulsively, I wanted to take a step back and explore the broader implications of what‚Äôs happening with Tesla and the U.S. market as a whole.

Now, I‚Äôm not claiming to have all the answers. In fact, I know that no one person can fully grasp the entire landscape‚Äîthere are just too many moving parts. That‚Äôs exactly why we‚Äôre here: to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and grow smarter together. If you think I‚Äôve got something wrong, by all means, correct me‚ÄîI welcome it.

With that said, I‚Äôll get straight to the point: like many of you, I believe Tesla‚Äôs current stock price is inflated beyond what makes sense for a car company. That‚Äôs not up for debate in my view. The real question is when it‚Äôs going to come back down to earth.

I think some of the hardcore short sellers may have shown up too early to the party. Yes, they‚Äôre making noise and causing some damage, but it‚Äôs still early days. The key reason? Elon and Trump still have enough firepower‚Äîboth financial and cultural‚Äîto prop this thing up, at least for the short term. Between their loyal fanbases and their connections to wealthy, influential backers, they‚Äôre capable of swinging retail sentiment when needed.

From a technical perspective, we also appear to be entering the Last Point of Supply (LPSY) phase in Wyckoff distribution. That‚Äôs the stage where the stock experiences one final upward thrust before demand dries up and the markdown phase begins. We won‚Äôt be able to confirm this until after the fact, but this setup suggests there may still be one last upswing before reality sets in.

And let‚Äôs not forget how easily Elon and Trump can manufacture short-term narratives to keep the hype train rolling. For example:

1. Elon announces a new, cheaper model with an overly optimistic delivery timeline.

2. Trump announces plans to transition the federal vehicle fleet to Teslas.

3. A surprise decision is made to standardize all federal charging stations to Tesla‚Äôs NAC.

4. Suddenly, a new mandate appears‚Äîevery automaker must adopt the NAC standard ‚Äúby tomorrow.‚Äù

5, Tesla remains the only EV maker eligible for tax credits, while competitors lose out.

All hypothetical, of course‚Äîbut not far-fetched. These kinds of announcements, even if temporary or empty promises, are more than enough to juice the stock price and keep hope alive a little longer.

But here‚Äôs the thing: this won‚Äôt work in the long run. The brand itself is becoming radioactive. Tesla is quickly approaching the kind of cultural toxicity we associate with names like ‚ÄúAdolf‚Äù or the toothbrush mustache. No matter how much mental gymnastics some bagholders perform, you can‚Äôt deny the rot underneath. The company has shown no real innovation, has no competitive moat, and has been delivering nothing but negative headlines for months.

1. Tesla's stock has experienced a significant decline of nearly 50% in three months, reducing its market capitalization from an all-time high of $1.5 trillion to $845 billion.

2. Tesla experienced its first annual sales decline in over a decade, with a 1.1% drop in 2024 compared to 2023, selling 1.79 million vehicles globally.

3. In February, Tesla's sales in Norway and Denmark were down by 48% year over year, while sales in Sweden declined by 42%.

4. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, urged employees to hold onto their stock amidst a significant surge in vehicle trade-ins and dealership vandalism.

7. Tesla Cybertruck sales dropped by 32.5% in February, and a new recall isn't helping matters either. [https://insideevs.com/news/754161/tesla-cybertruck-sales-falling-panels](https://insideevs.com/news/754161/tesla-cybertruck-sales-falling-panels)

8. Tesla's automotive revenues have fallen in tandem, with sales revenues declining by 7.7% last year, to $72.48 billion from $78.5 billion in 2023. [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-03-21/teslas-charmed-journey-coming-to-an-end](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-03-21/teslas-charmed-journey-coming-to-an-end) 

9. In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060)  If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.

As of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.

On December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.

Going back to the whole CEO encourage people to not sell their stock, we have many examples in history that tell us this is an ""Oh Shit"" moment.

In September 2001, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay urged employees to buy more Enron shares, reassuring them that the company's upcoming quarterly financial report was ""looking great."" He stated, ""The company is fundamentally sound. At current stock prices... this seems to be an incredibly cheap stock."" Shortly after Lay's assurances, Enron disclosed massive financial losses and accounting irregularities, leading to a rapid decline in stock value. The company filed for bankruptcy in December 2001, marking one of the most infamous corporate collapses in history. [https://www.recordnet.com/story/news/2002/01/19/ceo-urged-buying-stock/50764571007/](https://www.recordnet.com/story/news/2002/01/19/ceo-urged-buying-stock/50764571007/)

In the months leading up to Lehman Brothers' collapse, CEO Richard Fuld and other top executives publicly expressed confidence in the firm's financial stability. Despite these assurances, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008, marking one of the largest failures in financial history and a pivotal event in the global financial crisis.

In March 2008, Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz publicly stated that the firm was not facing a liquidity crisis, aiming to reassure investors and employees about the company's stability. Days after these statements, Bear Stearns faced a severe liquidity crunch, leading to its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase at a significantly reduced stock price, highlighting the rapid deterioration of its financial position. We're not there yet, but JPMorgan pt is $120.

Angelo Mozilo, CEO of Countrywide Financial, consistently expressed optimism about the company's prospects amid rising concerns about the subprime mortgage market. Despite Mozilo's positive outlook, Countrywide suffered massive losses due to its exposure to subprime mortgages, leading to its acquisition by Bank of America in 2008 as the financial crisis unfolded.

I‚Äôve lived through enough so-called ‚Äúonce-in-a-lifetime‚Äù financial events to know when the market is out of whack‚Äîand we are definitely in one of those moments.

Before we zoom out to talk about the broader economy, I want to challenge you to look around your own community. Talk to small business owners. Ask how their foot traffic and revenue are doing. Most will tell you business is down. People simply have less money and are spending less.

You can even see the signs in the everyday stuff:

\- Less traffic on the roads.

\- Empty parking lots where there used to be crowds.

\- Local shops offering more discounts, desperate to get people through the door.

These are the subtle, everyday indicators that the economy is softening‚Äînot just in isolated pockets, but everywhere from California to Maine.

And it‚Äôs not just consumers‚Äîfarmers are on the brink. Operating costs are soaring, demand is shrinking, and programs that used to keep them afloat‚Äîlike USAID‚Äîare being cut. Add to that tariffs on our allies, and we‚Äôre creating a ripple effect that could drag the entire global economy down with us.

The signs on the macro level are many at the moment. For example, Consumers make up about 70% of U.S. GDP, so when people stop spending, the economy slows down. Lower retail sales, slower restaurant traffic, fewer car purchases, and decreased discretionary spending are all down. Next week. we have durable goods orders, GDP growth rate QoQ, core PCE price index, personal income, and personal spending. 

By definition, a recession is often (though not officially) defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. We won't see this for a while, but by the time we see this, there is no point in me writing this post because I will just be captain obvious. However, the thing we should look for, the Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) and Industrial Production reports often show early weakness. A reading below 50 in the PMI signals contraction in the manufacturing sector ‚Äî a major red flag. As of February 2025, the U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 50.3, indicating a slight expansion in the manufacturing sector. This reflects a marginal decrease from January's PMI of 50.9.

Looking at unemployment rate, when companies expect slower growth, they lay off workers. If we see an increase in unemployment rate and initial jobless claims, it would fit our thesis that our economy is getting ready to eat shit, and no amount of bullshit will save luxury goods like Tesla from the crash. As of February 2025, the U.S. unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, a slight increase from 4.0% in January.

Another key indicator to watch is the yield curve, particularly when it becomes inverted ‚Äî a condition that has contributed to the strange and unpredictable market behavior we've seen over the past couple of weeks. A yield curve inversion occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates, most commonly measured by comparing the 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Under normal conditions, long-term bonds yield more than short-term ones because of the risks associated with time. But when investors grow pessimistic about the economic outlook, they start buying more long-term bonds (driving those yields down), while short-term rates remain elevated ‚Äî often due to central bank policy. This reversal in the yield curve is widely interpreted as the bond market signaling a potential economic downturn. Historically, the 2-year/10-year inversion has been one of the most reliable predictors of recessions in the U.S., accurately signaling nearly every major economic downturn since World War II. While I‚Äôm not an expert in the mechanics behind this, I‚Äôve been noticing that the recent yield curve dynamics are likely playing a role in the market volatility and erratic swings we've been witnessing. These sharp ups and downs aren‚Äôt happening in a vacuum ‚Äî they're part of a broader pattern of uncertainty and shifting investor sentiment rooted in concerns about future economic health.

Then we have the earnings. When companies begin missing revenue and earnings targets, it can reflect a slowdown in sales and consumer demand. The next few months will be the make-it-or-break-it for the economy. So far, many larger company has been missing their revenue and earning targets--looking at you walmart and target. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs just my two cents. A lot of people have been saying that the market is acting irrationally ‚Äî that the recent swings and volatility don't make sense. But from where I stand, especially when considering the actions of market manipulators and the broader economic indicators, the market actually appears very rational ‚Äî just not in the way most people expect.

What we‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt chaos without cause; it‚Äôs a market reacting to carefully orchestrated narratives, short-term hype, and policy signals. Of course, I also believe that the government and major institutions are doing what they can to project confidence and calm public sentiment, likely to prevent panic selling and maintain a sense of stability. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean things are fine ‚Äî it just means they're trying to delay the consequences.

For those of us paying attention, now is the time to really reflect. This moment calls for managing our risks, thinking critically, and planning how we want to move forward in an economy that feels increasingly uncertain. Whether that means reallocating investments, building cash reserves, or reassessing personal and business goals, it‚Äôs important we stay proactive rather than reactive.",2025-03-22 17:53:10,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/
1jhe6r8,Tesla‚Äôs End-of-Lease Vehicle Accounting: How Falling Resale Values Impact Liabilities (2024-2025),"I recently came across a post discussing Tesla‚Äôs leasing model and its implications for the company‚Äôs financials. Given the current negative sentiment around Tesla‚Äîdue to Elon Musk‚Äôs controversial actions and statements‚ÄîI decided to dig into the numbers using Deep Research. One of the biggest concerns right now is **the sharp decline in Tesla‚Äôs resale values**, which has significant implications for its leasing business and financial obligations.

# What Happens When Tesla Lease Vehicles Are Returned?

Tesla offers both **direct leases** (where it owns the leased vehicle) and **third-party leases** (where banks own the car, and Tesla guarantees a minimum resale value). When leases end, Tesla either:

1. **Resells the vehicle as a used car** (increasing ‚ÄúServices and Other‚Äù revenue).
2. **Releases it for another lease** (keeping it on its balance sheet as an asset).
3. **Buys back the vehicle under resale value guarantees** if a third-party lessor is involved.

# How Tesla Accounts for End-of-Lease Vehicles

1. **Operating Lease Vehicles, Net (Balance Sheet Asset):**
   * As of **December 31, 2024**, Tesla reported **$5.58 billion** in vehicles leased to customers (net of depreciation).
   * This asset declines as Tesla sells off or re-leases vehicles.
2. **Resale Value Guarantees (Potential Liability):**
   * Tesla **guarantees** buybacks for some leases.
   * Their maximum **end-of-lease exposure** under these guarantees **ballooned to $1.45 billion** in late 2024, up from just $166 million in 2023.
   * Despite this, Tesla reported the actual booked **liability as ‚Äúimmaterial‚Äù**‚Äîwhich now seems questionable given resale price drops. I expect this to be burred in the next earnings release so I'm keeping an eye on this.

# Tesla‚Äôs Resale Value is Crashing‚ÄîHow Does This Affect Liabilities?

Historically, Tesla‚Äôs used car prices were strong, allowing them to resell lease returns at a good margin. However:

* **Used Tesla prices plunged \~10-15% YoY**, especially for Model 3 and Y.
* This is due to **increased competition (Rivian, BYD, Hyundai, Ford)**, falling EV demand, and **Musk‚Äôs reputation issues driving away some buyers**.
* **Tesla is now selling used cars for LESS than their assumed residual values** in many cases.

# üö® Why This is a Big Problem üö®

1. **Tesla May Need to Take Write-Downs on Leased Vehicles**
   * If actual resale values **drop below Tesla‚Äôs estimated residual values**, they have to recognize an **impairment charge** on their books.
   * So far, they‚Äôve **avoided** reporting major write-downs, but Q1/Q2 2025 earnings could reflect this.
2. **Resale Value Guarantees Become Costly**
   * Tesla promised to buy back certain third-party-leased cars at pre-agreed prices.
   * If market values are far lower, **Tesla takes the loss**‚Äîthis could hit margins hard.
3. **Profitability of the Leasing Model Declines**
   * With resale values falling, leasing becomes **less profitable**, or Tesla is forced to raise lease prices to compensate.
   * Tesla‚Äôs financing arm may need to adjust **future lease residual values downward**, which **hurts growth** in this revenue stream.

# What to Watch For in Tesla‚Äôs Next Earnings Reports

* **Are they recognizing a provision for lease impairments?**
* **Has the resale value guarantee liability increased?**
* **Are they slowing down new lease originations due to higher residual risk?**

# Final Thoughts

Tesla has gotten away with minimal provisions for lease losses so far, but the reality of **falling resale prices** could force them to take a hit soon. If the used Tesla market doesn‚Äôt recover, **expect impairments and higher lease-related losses in 2025**.

This is not financial advice ‚Äî just a curious Redditor sharing their research. For transparency, I do hold some long puts expiring in September and I‚Äôve been selling weekly puts ahead of earnings while implied volatility is elevated. I don‚Äôt necessarily expect this upcoming earnings release to be the catalyst for a major sell-off, but I do think Q2 could look worse if something drastic isn‚Äôt done.

Do you think the stock will correct or tank on poor earnings?

1jgj4af,Tesla‚Äôs Retail Fans Buy the Stock at a Pace Never Seen Before,"Tesla Inc.‚Äôs stock is in a freefall. Its sales are plunging around the world. Even its most avid Wall Street bulls are turning cautious. But one group is buying the electric-vehicle maker‚Äôs shares like never before: CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs fans.
The company has always had a strong fan-base among individual investors, who hang on Musk‚Äôs every word on X, the social-media platform he owns. They analyze Tesla in great detail in online forums, and largely function as a hype crew for the stock.
But their current level of enthusiasm is staggeringly high, even by recent historical standards. Individual investors have been net buyers of Tesla shares for 13 straight sessions through Thursday, pumping $8 billion into the stock, retail trading data from JPMorgan Chase‚Äôs global equity derivatives strategist Emma Wu shows. That‚Äôs the biggest inflow over any buying streak since 2015, which is as far back as the data goes.

What makes the buying notable is Tesla‚Äôs share price has sunk 17% over this time, wiping out more than $155 billion from its market value.
‚ÄúTesla made some rookie to mid-stage public market investors extremely wealthy, a lot of people became millionaires because of this stock,‚Äù said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research. ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt forget that. And they will come back to a stock again and again if they feel it has been beaten up.‚Äù
Tesla shares have been on a steep slide since mid-December when it touched an all-time high fueled by optimism from Donald Trump‚Äôs election victory. But that euphoria vanished, with the stock retreating more than 50% from its Dec. 17 record, making it the second biggest decliner in the S&P 500 Index this year. The rout has been so brutal that on Thursday Musk sought to reassure Tesla employees during an all-hands meeting, telling them to ‚Äúhang on to your stock.‚Äù

What‚Äôs become clear is what Wall Street thought was a bonus for the company, Musk‚Äôs prominent role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has become an albatross. His growing political presence and involvement with controversies in Europe have triggered a backlash against the company and its leader, with the cars increasingly seen as political symbols. Protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails at Tesla showrooms, and vandalized charging stations.

The impact is showing up in the company‚Äôs financials. Sales of the Tesla‚Äôs cars have sunk in key European markets, such as France and Germany, as well as in China and Australia. The US numbers won‚Äôt be available until the company reports its first-quarter delivery figures early next month, but analysts across Wall Street have been aggressively cutting their estimates for sales and profits, citing the bleak data from around the globe.

On Thursday, long-time Tesla bull and Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lowered his price target on the stock and reduced his sales expectations for the company citing growing competition, an aging vehicle lineup and a ‚Äúbuyers‚Äô strike from negative brand sentiment.‚Äù However, he kept his buy-equivalent rating on the shares, saying the weak near-term expectations are ‚Äúnot particularly narrative changing‚Äù for a company whose future depends on robotics and artificial intelligence.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives on Friday lauded Musk‚Äôs efforts for ‚Äúhand holding‚Äù employees and investors at a key time, and said that if the CEO continued to lead on his vision the stock will be on a growth path where 90% of its valuation will be led by autonomous driving technology and robotics. This bullishness explains at least some of retail traders‚Äô continuing enthusiasm for the shares.
‚ÄúThese kind of investors don‚Äôt care about valuations at all,‚Äù Colas said. ‚ÄúThey just believe in the future of the company and Elon Musk‚Äôs abilities.‚Äù

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven ‚Äî which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) ‚Äî is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

1jg4o6x,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

""These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,"" Caldwell said.

""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.""

1jfx9en,$UBER: Self Driving King Maker,"‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your night been bro?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow long you been driving Uber for?‚Äù, ‚Äúcan I drink and vape in here?‚Äù, these are just some of the things which will slowly disappear as self driving taxis become more and more commonplace. 

BUT, do you know what‚Äôs not going to disappear? Uber!

Oh but Waymo will just launch its own ride sharing platform and same with Tesler (the best all computer mode of transportation on the market). This is the counter point we generally hear to Uber‚Äôs relevance in the next 10+ years. 

This fails to take into account two things: 
1) Making a self driving car is incredibly difficult until it‚Äôs not. 
2) We are 10+ years minimum until full self driving is widespread enough to be a global everyday option.
3) Companies don‚Äôt care about monopolies they care about making money and return on investment.

Point 1: Same thing people were saying with Tesla and electric vehicles. First mover advantage, by the time everyone catches up Tesla will be a million miles ahead of everyone. We now see that it‚Äôs not that hard once the foundational level tech has been developed and eventually all cars will have an electric vehicle if they want. 

Point 2: We are so far away from full self driving being an everyday part of global life that there is an incredible amount of cash burn still required and companies will compete to make the best self driving car, NOT spending ungodly amounts of money playing 20+ years of catchup on Uber. Keeping in mind that Uber continues to evolve and find new ways to screw their customers (incredibly bullish ü§ë)

Point 3: This goes hand in hand with point 2. There is still a tremendous amount of cash burn with self driving car companies such as Waymo and the easiest path to commercialisation is partnering with Uber. They will choose return on investment instead of monopolies every time and we are bringing to see this with Waymo. 

Also good financials, finally profitable, gross bookings up blah blah blah boring.

80 shares of Uber
Just cashed out my calls and Uber 2x leveraged shares but will go back in when the market finally shuts the bed before recovering.

1jfrju1,Tesla Fair Value,"TL;DR: If Tesla is no longer priced as a fast growing tech company, the P/E should drop to align with the rest of the automotive industry (10-12). That puts the fair value share price around $25. 

Recent data from various sources indicate that the global auto industry P/E ratio typically ranges between 15 and 20 when considering a broad set of companies. However, Tesla's significantly higher P/E ratio‚Äîoften cited above 100 (161.23 as of March 17, 2025)‚Äîskews the industry average upward when included. Excluding Tesla, the average P/E ratio for traditional automakers tends to be much lower, reflecting their more established, slower-growth business models compared to Tesla's growth-oriented valuation.Focusing on major automakers excluding Tesla, here are some representative P/E ratios based on recent data:

* Toyota: Approximately 9.7
* General Motors (GM): Around 9.13
* Ford: About 6.74
* Honda: Around 7.3
* Stellantis: Approximately 6.5
* Volkswagen (VW): Around 4.0
* Hyundai: Approximately 2.9

These figures indicate that traditional automakers have P/E ratios typically in the single digits to low teens. To estimate the average P/E ratio excluding Tesla, we can take a simple average of these representative companies:

* (9.7 + 9.13 + 6.74 + 7.3 + 6.5 + 4.0 + 2.9) / 7 = approximately 6.61

However, broader industry analyses (e.g., from Simply Wall St or Nasdaq) suggest that the U.S. or global auto industry average, when Tesla‚Äôs outsized P/E is excluded, typically falls between 8 and 12, depending on the sample of companies and market conditions. The U.S. auto industry's 3-year average P/E is noted at 72.0x, but this is heavily influenced by Tesla; without it, the average drops significantly, aligning closer to the 8-12 range cited. Given the variability and the lack of a single definitive dataset in the provided references, a reasonable estimate based on the data is:

* Average P/E ratio in the automotive industry, excluding Tesla: Approximately 8 to 12, with a midpoint around 10.

This range reflects the lower valuations of traditional automakers, which are less growth-focused than Tesla, and is consistent with current sentiment and comparative financial metrics as of March 20, 2025. For a more precise figure, additional data from a comprehensive set of automakers would be needed, but this range provides a solid approximation based on available information.

1jfidz3,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump‚Äôs latest trade policies are hammering the markets‚ÄîS&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%‚Äîand it looks like he‚Äôs doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he‚Äôs backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

‚úÖ **Tariffs as leverage** ‚Äì forcing trade partners into more ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù deals

‚úÖ **USMCA review (2026)** ‚Äì questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

‚úÖ **Hardline stance on China** ‚Äì blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**‚Äîall of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting‚Äîsome stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump‚Äôs protectionist approach. Trump‚Äôs tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump‚Äôs strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they ‚Äúimprove border security‚Äù and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can‚Äôt plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",2025-03-20 06:08:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/

We've fallen close to 10% overnight in TUR, the Turkey ETF. Overall this likely won't see recovery for a few months. Last coup I remember was back in 2016 and it took a few months for TUR to recover (and it didn't do so linearly) so ultimately not interested in this. Continued political unrest and potential sanctions could further devalue Turkish assets, but I doubt there will be any outside intervention. EEM (the emerging markets ETF) seems to be unaffected overall.

1jetgkm,Tesla gets first in a series of permits it needs to run robotaxis in California,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - Tesla¬†[(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O)¬†on Tuesday received the first in a series of approvals from California required for the electric car maker to eventually launch a promised robotaxi service in the state, according to a state regulator.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said it approved Tesla's application for a¬†[transportation charter-party carrier permit](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeking-approval-offer-ride-hailing-services-california-bloomberg-news-2025-02-27/)¬†(TCP), a license typically associated with chauffeur-operated services, allowing the company to own and control a fleet of vehicles and transport employees on pre-arranged trips.

The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO¬†[Elon Musk](https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk/)¬†pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the¬†[Cybercab](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/), a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.

1jek6fx,Why Tesla deserves a look and probably a Buy at these Levels,"We know the story, Elon‚Äôs right leanings are causing his core customers to revolt.

This has killed sentiment dropping the stock to uncanny low levels.

A few assumptions:

1. Analysts expect Revenue 3 years out are expected to be 200 billion. 

2. Tesla has had a P/S multiple between 6 and 28 historically

I built a matrix pricing Tesla between 6 to 10x sales and looked at sales of 150,180,200,210,225 (-25%,-10%,base,5%,12.5%) on that revenue estimate

This yields a market cap of 900 to 2,250 or a 3 year return ranging between 7.47% and 45.86% per year! They have also had minimal dilution in recent years.

I know I know, Elon is doing irreparable harm to the Tesla brand! It‚Äôs just like chipotle with ecoli, VW cheated on emissions, Equifax leaking all our data, Wells Fargo opening accounts and so on. 

DOGE is set to terminate in July of 2026 starting the distancing from Trump

For better or worse, fair or unfair, Tesla likely has a regulatory advantage in getting FSD approved thanks to Elon‚Äôs position. 

Overtime I expect Tesla will be valued like Apple, not legacy auto. Why? Well for one, Tesla doesn‚Äôt have a banking arm so that makes it far different than legacy auto for comparisons. Apple has lumpy iPhone sales followed by big fat juicy service revenue. Tesla, at maturity has the same potential. Lumpy car sales with subscriptions to FSD, Insurance, App Store, robo-taxi, repairs and maintenance, etc. this is the reason I used 6-10x sales above. These are around the multiple Apple has been valued at in recent years.

Additionally, the following is True:

They sell cars at retail prices to consumers whereas legacy auto sells cars wholesale to dealers.

They are one of the few to make EVs profitable at scale and have been wise to lower prices to levels legacy auto can‚Äôt compete at.

Tesla has many call options on its business with robotics and FSD

Never mix politics and portfolios

Best of Luck!

1jeb0sq,"Tesla board members, executive sell off over $100 million of stock in recent weeks","As Tesla stock has fallen in recent weeks, members of the board and an executive at Elon Musk's company have been selling off millions of dollars in stock, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Together, four top officers at the company have offloaded over $100 million in shares since early February.

Last week, longtime Musk ally James Murdoch -- the estranged son of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch and a board member since 2017 -- became the latest to do so, exercising a stock option and selling shares worth approximately $13 million, according to an SEC filing. The sale took place on March 10, coinciding with the stock's largest single-day decline in five years.

According to one filing, the shares were sold ""to cover the exercise price relating to the exercise of stock options to purchase 531,787 shares, which are scheduled to expire in 2025.""

Elon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, who also sits on the board, unloaded 75,000 shares worth approximately $27 million last month, according to a filing.

The chairman of the board, Robyn Denholm, has offloaded more than $75 million dollars worth of shares in two transactions in the past five weeks, federal filings show. The selloffs made by Denholm came as part of a predetermined sales plan.

A number of board members and executives made similar moves in November and December. But the recent sales come at a tumultuous time for Tesla, with the stock falling nearly 50% from a peak in mid-December. The company's shares have suffered most of those losses since President Donald Trump took office and Musk began his controversial governmental cost-cutting efforts as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.

""Whenever insiders, including directors, are selling shares, it's not a positive signal,"" Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News.

However, Ritter added, an exception applies to the predetermined sales plan adopted by Denholm in July 2024, which marks a routine effort to avoid the perception an officer unloaded shares based on inside information.

""Filing a plan months ago to sell some of those shares over time is common,"" Ritter said.

Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.

Seth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar who studies the electric vehicle industry, said some of the stock sales may owe to personal financial choices made by individual officers.

""While a sale doesn't necessarily mean an executive or board member feels negatively about a company's outlook, it could mean they think the stock is at a fair price or even overvalued,"" Goldstein said.

The share selloffs made by board members and executives totaled about $118 million, but the transactions often came after the individuals exercised stock options, the costs of which totaled about $16 million. The officers ended up with a profit of just over $100 million.

ABC News previously reported on concerns from shareholders and pension funds, some of whom have called on Musk to turn his attention back from slashing government spending to running his car company.

Tesla Chief Financial officer Vaibhav Taneja also sold off shares totaling more than $5 million over recent weeks. Some of those transactions came as part of predetermined sales plans, but a transaction earlier this month did not stem from a scheduled sale.

This technology will debut in the upcoming Han L sedan and Tang L SUV models set to launch in April. Negative bias. We're down close to 50% since post-election highs and we've had even more bad news yesterday due to the video showing the limitation of non-LIDAR cars.

Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn‚Äôt done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA¬†has lost its previous momentum and isn‚Äôt showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company‚Äôs questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla‚Äôs manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining.¬†

Musk‚Äôs intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven‚Äôt been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk‚Äôs leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock‚Äôs poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

1jbcflu,S&P 500 Stages Rebound After $5 Trillion Plunge: Markets Wrap,">A bounce in¬†stocks¬†calmed nerves among equity investors, but the fallout from¬†Donald Trump‚Äôs political maneuvering continued to shake global markets and rattle US consumers. Yields on¬†German bonds¬†surged as government leaders agreed on a massive defense spending package, while the ultimate haven asset ‚Äî¬†gold¬†‚Äî topped $3,000 for the first time.

>The almost 2% advance in the¬†S&P 500¬†was set to be the biggest since the aftermath of the¬†presidential election. Not even data showing a slide in¬†consumer confidence¬†prevented the market rebound. That follows a selloff that culminated in a 10% plunge of the US equity benchmark from its peak.¬†Treasuries¬†trimmed a recent rally fueled by a flight to safety. Bullion climbed as much as 0.5% to $3,004.94 an ounce before erasing gains.

>The moves capped a week of drama that included Trump‚Äôs on-and-off-again tariffs, recession calls, geopolitical talks and concerns over a US government shutdown. Combined with all the questioning around lofty tech valuations,¬†global equity funds¬†saw their biggest redemption this year.

>‚ÄúThe markets are grappling with the notion of where fair value rests for a stock market that faces headwinds from tariffs, fiscal spending cuts, and potentially softening economic data, said¬†Yung-Yu Ma¬†at BMO Wealth Management. ‚ÄúNegative investor sentiment is building, so a multi-day relief rally could be coming soon.‚Äù

>Despite Friday‚Äôs advance, the¬†S&P 500¬†still headed toward a fourth straight week of losses ‚Äî the longest such streak since August.¬†Trading volume¬†was 10% below the average of the past month. Tech megacaps led gains on Friday, with¬†Nvidia Corp.¬†and¬†Tesla Inc.¬†up at least 3.3%. The¬†Nasdaq 100¬†climbed 2.1%. The¬†Dow Jones Industrial Average¬†added 1.4%.

>The yield on 10-year¬†Treasuries¬†advanced three basis points to 4.30%. A¬†dollar¬†gauge fell 0.2%.

>‚ÄúWe are seeing some oversold rally efforts once again,‚Äù said¬†Dan Wantrobski¬†at Janney Montgomery Scott. ‚ÄúBut we caution folks looking to dive back in at the first sign of stability here: nearly everyone is looking for a bottom and to ‚Äòbuy the dip‚Äô at some point, but the current condition of the markets has not implied any real improvement on a technical basis - the tape is simply very oversold at this stage.‚Äù

>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know. We would like to see a capitulation trade, but the seasonals are starting to turn,‚Äù Brenner said. ‚ÄúThe end of February to the middle of March is an awful time for equity seasonals.‚Äù

>It took just 16 trading sessions for US stocks to tumble into a correction, leaving a frazzled Wall Street asking just how long the ‚Äúadjustment period‚Äù White House officials have warned about will last.

>In the prior 24 instances when stocks have fallen at least 10% from a record but avoided a bear market, it has taken an average of¬†eight months to reclaim¬†an all-time high, according to data from CFRA Research. That would leave the Feb. 19 high intact until mid-October. The average drawdown reached 14% in those cases.

>‚ÄúCorrections are unnerving in the moment, though they are not unusual, and often act as a pressure release valve for overheated markets,‚Äù said¬†Mark Hackett¬†at Nationwide. ‚ÄúThis will not be the last correction, pullback, or market scare that the bulls will have to face, and yes, an element of caution is warranted.‚Äù

>‚ÄúWe say this is a correction, not a bear market in US stocks,‚Äù Bank of America Corp.‚Äôs¬†Michael Hartnett¬†said. ‚ÄúSince equity bear threatens recession, fresh declines in stock prices will provoke flip in trade and monetary policy.‚Äù

>Yet a century-old indicator that has helped predict the direction of the US stock market is signaling more pain ahead for battered investors.

>Known as the¬†Dow Theory, it holds that moves in the Dow Jones Industrial Average must be confirmed by transport stocks, and vice versa, to be sustained. As of Thursday‚Äôs close, the 20-member Dow Jones Transportation Average ‚Äî a barometer of consumer and industrial demand ‚Äî has slumped 19% from its November peak, teetering near so-called bear-market territory.

>‚ÄúWhat usually differentiates quicker (often healthy) selloffs from drawn-out bear markets is whether a recession follows,‚Äù said Ross Mayfield at Baird Private Wealth Management.

>The 23 non-recession corrections since 1965 averaged a 16% drawdown, he said. Meantime, the 8 recession selloffs over that period averaged a 36% drawdown.

>‚ÄúThe good news is that despite headwinds, a near-term recession still looks unlikely,‚Äù he noted.

>Though administration officials have repeatedly said that they view the current stock market correction as a temporary reaction to the president‚Äôs pro-Main Street agenda, eventually Trump will react, the bank‚Äôs chief investment strategist said in his weekly analysis of market trends.

>‚ÄúWe say this is a correction, not a bear market in U.S. stocks,‚Äù Hartnett wrote. ‚Äù[M]arkets stop panicking when policy makers start panicking‚Äô ‚Ä¶ since equity bear threatens recession, fresh declines in stock prices will provoke flip in trade & monetary policy back to ‚Äòhe loves me‚Äô stance.‚Äù

But will the selling continue? Is today the bottom?

>Hartnett thinks the market damage will be limited, but he doesn‚Äôt expect the selling is over yet.

>The large-cap S&P 500 index would be ‚Äúa good buy‚Äù should it hit 5,300, which would be another 4% lower from Thursday‚Äôs close, and when institutional investors‚Äô cash levels surge above 4%.

>One ‚Äúominous‚Äù sign that he sees during the current sell-off is the simultaneous decline in both stocks and Treasury yields, a trend he said is similar to market behavior in 2000, 2002 and the 2008 financial crisis period.

>‚ÄúGood news is financial conditions [are] easing‚Äù Hartnett noted, citing lower yields as well as declines in the U.S. dollar and oil.‚Äù Hartnett added that ‚Äúcorrections end once sell-off ‚Äòlaggards‚Äô crack,‚Äù citing rising credit spreads.

1jaciwt,Tesla (TSLA) Stock: Trump‚Äôs Purchase Fails to Sustain Rally,"Who knew that the publicity stunt on the WH lawn and a clear attempted pump wouldn't last. Do not buy the dip!

https://moneycheck.com/tesla-tsla-stock-trumps-purchase-fails-to-sustain-rally/

Tesla‚Äôs stock price continues to show volatility in early March trading, falling 0.9% in premarket activity after two days of gains. This follows Monday‚Äôs steep 15.4% drop that marked the company‚Äôs worst trading day in nearly five years.

The electric vehicle maker saw its shares rebound 7.6% on Wednesday and 3.8% on Tuesday. These gains came after President Donald Trump‚Äôs public commitment to purchase a Tesla Model S during a White House event with CEO Elon Musk.

Despite the recent uptick, Tesla stock remains down almost 50% from its mid-December record high. The current price hovers around $245.75 in premarket trading.",2025-03-13 13:55:53,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jaciwt/tesla_tsla_stock_trumps_purchase_fails_to_sustain/

1j9mlkx,Tesla investor survey shows 85% believe Elon Musk‚Äôs politics are having ‚Äònegative‚Äô or ‚Äòextremely negative‚Äô impact on company,"More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe¬†Tesla¬†CEO¬†Elon Musk‚Äôs controversial political activities are hurting his business.

In total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk‚Äôs foray into politics has either had a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù or ‚Äúextremely negative‚Äù impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.

While a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he‚Äôs become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla‚Äôs stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.

When asked about Musk‚Äôs efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an ‚Äúextremely negative‚Äù impact.

On the other hand, 3% said they were ‚Äúpositive‚Äù for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them ‚Äúinsignificant.‚Äù

To be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.

Jonas also asked about expectations for the company‚Äôs performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What‚Äôs more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent¬†reports of vandalism¬†could¬†spook potential customers.

Just 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.

Musk‚Äôs political profile has grown after his public support of President¬†Donald Trump¬†in the runup up to last year‚Äôs election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive‚Äôs efforts to slash the federal government‚Äôs spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.

Musk¬†acknowledged¬†in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump‚Äôs administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, ‚Äúwith great difficulty.‚Äù That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their¬†worst session since 2020.

Despite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.

After a New York Times¬†report¬†last week unearthed criticisms of Musk‚Äôs team from members of Trump‚Äôs cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models¬†parked at the White House¬†after the president¬†said¬†on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.

Trump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.

1j8v68z,Waymo expands robotaxi service in Silicon Valley,"Waymo on Tuesday announced it is expanding its service to include another 27 square miles of coverage around the San Francisco Bay Area.

With the expansion, Waymo will now take passengers around Mountain View, Los Altos, Palo Alto and parts of Sunnyvale, California. The Alphabet-owned company opened its robotaxi service to the general public in San Francisco in June.

Waymo will initially limit the availability of its Silicon Valley service to users of the Waymo One app who are residents with ZIP codes in the area, the company said. Waymo plans to serve more riders across the region over time. The fleet of vehicles that will be in use in the new coverage areas are fully electric Jaguar I-Pace vehicles with Waymo‚Äôs fifth generation of self-driving sensors, software and other technology.

‚ÄúOpening our fully autonomous ride-hailing service in Silicon Valley marks a special milestone in our Bay Area journey,‚Äù Waymo product chief Saswat Panigrahi said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis is where Waymo began and where we‚Äôre headquartered.‚Äù

Waymo expanded its San Francisco Bay Area robotaxi service last summer into Daly City, Broadmoor and Colma. Its robotaxis do not yet carry passengers to San Francisco International Airport.

A spokesperson told CNBC that Waymo is in ‚Äúactive discussions with SFO,‚Äù and added that the company is ‚Äúworking to connect‚Äù Silicon Valley and San Francisco to ‚Äúprovide seamless autonomous rides across more of the Bay Area in the future.‚Äù

Waymo also recently launched a commercial robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, just in time for the city‚Äôs annual South by Southwest festival.

While would-be competitors including Elon Musk‚Äôs automaker Tesla, and Amazon-owned Zoox, are continuing their own robotaxi testing and development, Waymo has pulled far ahead of self-driving companies in the U.S. 

Before Tuesday‚Äôs expansion, Waymo said it was serving more than 200,000 paid trips per week across San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix.

Alphabet doesn‚Äôt disclose financial results for the autonomous vehicle business, but Waymo is part of its ‚ÄúOther Bets.‚Äù That business unit generated $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 and incurred operating losses of $1.17 billion, according to the company‚Äôs most recent financial filing.

This, compounded with the fact that, since he has gone ‚ÄúDark MAGA ‚Äú, many of the key demographics here in the good old USA are like ‚ÄúF NO!‚Äù, or anything but a Tesla. Now, I don‚Äôt condone violence, but when there is civil disobedience, things like vandalism seem fairly low down on the bad outcome side. A lot of people that work in government are losing their livelihood. Other people are losing critical services. A storm is brewing and owning a Tesla is a badge of courage at this point. Conservatives have not rushed in to fill the demand side issues. Most I know would NEVER buy a sissymobile.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

We had a hell of a selloff yesterday. I see today as an attempt to recover, not too interested in going short on the market today unless we break new lows. Trying out a new layout today.

Saw these move mainly due to recession fears and the entire market panicking, MASSIVE move yesterday.

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts. We've also seen a decently large move in the VIX (VXX) and we're close to above 60- I'm interested in shorting if we're above $60 but doubt we'll hit that today.

CEO/co-founder, Dustin Moskovitz announced retirement. The company reported Q4 revenues of $188.3M, a 10% YoY increase, and issued a revenue outlook for fiscal 2026 below expectations (resulting in the drop).

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

**Ticker:** [**AAL (American Airlines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAL&p=d)

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse. Overall we're seeing a slight recovery in the premarket but still watching to see how this trades.

1j8fg5d,Tech megacaps lose over $750 billion in market cap in worst day for Nasdaq since 2022,"It‚Äôs gone from bad to worse for tech investors.

With the Nasdaq suffering its steepest drop since 2022 on Monday, the seven most valuable tech companies lost more than $750 billion in market value. Recession fears and concerns about a trade war drove the selloff.

Apple¬†led the megacap losses, with its value plummeting by about $174 billion.¬†Nvidia¬†shaved off almost $140 billion in market value and shares closed down 5%. The leading AI chipmaker has lost nearly a third of its value just two months after notching a fresh high in January.

Tesla¬†had the biggest percentage loss, with shares of the electric vehicle maker tumbling 15%, their worst day since 2020. The company has lost more than half its value since its stock price peaked in mid-December**.**¬†The stock is also coming off its¬†longest weekly losing streak in history¬†as a public company.

Tesla lost $130 billion in value on Monday, while¬†Microsoft¬†and¬†Alphabet¬†lost $98 billion and $95 billion, respectively.¬†Amazon¬†lost $50 billion and Meta lost $70 billion.

Alphabet¬†and¬†Meta¬†dropped more than 4% on Monday, while¬†Microsoft¬†and¬†Amazon¬†dropped at least 2% each. The¬†Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund¬†fell more than 4%, entering correction territory. Shares are more than 14% off their high.

Heavy selling intensified across the tech, with the Nasdaq falling to a six-month low. Many tech companies rely on parts and manufacturing overseas and new levies could push up prices. That‚Äôs also sparked worries of a U.S. recession, which¬†Trump didn‚Äôt rule out¬†over the weekend.

Semiconductor makers have also felt the pain, with the sector a primary target of new tariffs. Last week, the president announced an¬†additional $100 billion investment¬†from¬†Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing¬†and called the company the ‚Äúmost powerful‚Äù in the world as he looks to boost domestic production.

The¬†VanEck Semiconductor ETF¬†has plunged 3% over the past week and is down more than 16% since the inauguration. Heavy selling rattled the sector again Monday, with the ETF last down roughly 5%.¬†Marvell Technology¬†shed 8%, while¬†ASML Holding¬†and¬†Micron Technology¬†slumped more than 6% each.¬†Broadcom¬†fell 5%.

1j8e8xo,Tesla still a long ways to fall,"Much has been written about Tesla and the recent drop in stock price.   However, I believe Tesla still has a long ways to drop.    


**YoY Sales Decline**  
Sales in Europe are down 50%.  China is down 49% YoY and Australia saw a 76% decline YoY.  In the US, we know sales declined by 7% in 2024 vs 2023.   However, this was based on their 10k filing, which occurred before all of Elon's comments hit the news cycle (pre Nazi salute, DOGE, support for far right gov in Europe).

**Tesla Brand Damage**  
Tesla is Musk.  His comments in the media and related actions with DOGE have deeply hurt the Tesla brand.  If you look at Tesla's core audience it is left leaning, environmentally conscious Democrats.   Musks actions have completely alienated that demographic.   The Republicans aren't buying EV's and certainly not enough to offset a loss from the left.   A close analogy would be Bud Light and Trans Activist Dylan Mulvaney.   Sales dropped 30% and still haven't fully recovered.   Bud Light eventually fired the executives responsible for the campaign.   But there is next to 0 chance the Tesla Board jettisons Musk, as he has stacked the board with family members and loyalists.

Antidotally, I live in the Bay Area.  My social circle is left leaning White Collar professionals, Tesla's key demographic, and talking with co-workers/friends I don't know anybody who is planning to buy a Tesla.   I have some friends who have Tesla's but when their lease is up they don't plan on renewing or buying another one.   In my view Musk's political activism has permanently harmed the Tesla Brand.

  
**Valuation**  
Tesla EPS was $2.05 last year and currently trades at a P/E ratio of 108.  For comparison Toyota trades at a P/E ration of 7, Ford 6, and Mercedes at 5.    Stocks can trade at high P/E ratios based on rosy growth rates.   Musk has long touted that Tesla is an AI and RoboTaxi company, it's part of why Tesla trades at such lofty valuations.   However, I checked Tesla's 10k and 90% of their revenue comes from Automotive and Automotive Services.   They are very much a car company.       

Even if you were to say Tesla deserves a premium valuation of 20x earnings, that would put a valuation of \~$41, which is a sharp drop from where it currently trades at $222.15.   Yes, Tesla is a Meme Stock and traditional valuation metrics don't apply (i.e Gamestop).   But here's the rub.   Automotive companies have huge fixed costs.   Those factories and plants, cost a lot to build and finance.   A large drop in sales can get ugly real fast and generate huge losses.   There's no way to justify these lofty valuations when your sales are dropping and your company starts hemorrhaging  money.  At some point the illusion cracks.

1j8bbhl,"Tesla shares plunge 15%, suffering steepest drop in five years","Tesla‚Äôs¬†sell-off on Wall Street intensified on Monday, with shares of the electric vehicle maker plunging 15%, their worst day on the market since September 2020.

On Friday, Tesla¬†wrapped up¬†a seventh straight week of losses, its longest losing streak since debuting on the Nasdaq in 2010. The stock has fallen every week since CEO¬†Elon Musk¬†went to Washington, D.C., to take on a major role in the second Trump White House.

Since peaking at $479.86 on Dec. 17, Tesla shares have lost more than 50% of their value, wiping out upward of $800 billion in market cap. Monday marked the stock‚Äôs seventh worst day on record.

Tesla led a¬†broader slump¬†in U.S. equities, with the Nasdaq tumbling almost 4%, its steepest decline since 2022.

The downdraft in Tesla‚Äôs stock on Monday was tied to uncertainty surrounding¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs¬†plans on tariffs. Canada and Mexico are key markets for automotive suppliers, and increased tariffs, with the potential for a trade war, will likely affect production and lead to higher prices.

Tesla is also dealing with brand erosion due to Musk‚Äôs incendiary political rhetoric and his extensive work with the Trump administration, where he is leading up the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Musk, the world‚Äôs wealthiest person, has become the public face of the administration‚Äôs effort to dramatically shrink the federal government‚Äôs workforce, spending and capacity.

Meanwhile, Musk has used his social network X to level accusations against judges whose decisions he did not like and promoted false Kremlin talking points about Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Activists and former Musk fans have protested at Tesla facilities across the U.S., and Tesla vehicles and facilities have been the apparent targets of vandalism and arson attempts. Repeated arson attempts and instances of vandalism occurred at a Tesla store and service center in Loveland, Colorado, most recently on March 7, police told CNBC.

Ben Kallo, an analyst at Baird, told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk on the Street‚Äù on Monday that recent reports of vandalism could hurt demand.

‚ÄúWhen people‚Äôs cars are in jeopardy of being keyed or set on fire out there, even people who support Musk or are indifferent Musk might think twice about buying a Tesla,‚Äù Kallo said.

Analysts at Bank of America‚Äôs wrote in a report on Monday that Tesla‚Äôs new vehicle sales plummeted about 50% in Europe in January from a year earlier, partly owing to growing distaste for the brand. The firm also noted that some prospective customers are waiting for the new version of the Model Y.

Tesla‚Äôs Model Y, which is a small SUV, remained the best-selling battery electric vehicle globally in January. It was followed by China‚Äôs Geely Geome, which surpassed the Tesla Model 3 sedan for the month.

Global sales of electric vehicles, including fully electric and plug-in hybrid models, increased 21% in January from a year ago, even as Tesla‚Äôs sales declined. The growth was driven by demand in Europe, according to Bank of America.

1j7l0bv,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653¬†Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it‚Äôs an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

1j50cfd,Tesla going under 100 in year or 2 thesis,"Thesis:
1) Market crash
2) China out compete Tesla
3) Tesla FSD is a scam will never work until Musk accept Lidar. There are so many video out there showing Tesla has at least 1 critical disengagement every hundred Miles and you are telling me robotaxi is coming. It just don't work this way. Musk is stubborn and it is very difficult to change his mind. As a result, investor suffer. Vision only is not safe enough to achieve 10k miles per critical disengagement. It is just extremely difficult and even not possible or reliable.
4) Robotic optimus just not coming in next 5 years. You see how slow they roll out the development update? I wonder they are 9-5 employee working. By the time they roll out, China already start selling robot at 15k USD and they are selling 30k USD. 
5) Elon is too distracted, he already forget who help him to achieve what he want. If it was 2019 Elon who actually sleep in factory work hard together with the team, I think we might still have the chance. Right now his focus is with the country. By the time he is back, Tesla already 5 years behind China.

If you actually stop for a second and think with common sense, you should sell all of it as soon as it pop a little. If you wanna be cult and all in, it's up to you. In the end it's your money, you lose it all is your problem. I hope someone can share this with Elon and realized they are already years behind China in manufacturing and AI.

1j43x5l,These are the stocks on my watchlist (03/5) - Trump's Speech Dissect,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Today is mostly related to Trump's speech yesterday. Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday ""Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow"", so will be on the lookout for that.

News: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)**,** [**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

This sale is part of a previously adopted trading plan.

What Happened: Denholm has been steadily offloading Tesla shares over recent months. In early February, she sold 112,390 shares worth about $43.2 million, alongside CFO Vaibhav Taneja and board member Kimbal Musk, who also offloaded significant holdings.

This trend among Tesla insiders comes as the company navigates macroeconomic uncertainties and intensifying competition in the EV market.

Tariffs are here.

News: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. 

**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

1j2khkm,"Tesla sales plunges 70% in Norway, what might the future bring","Norway is a special market with almost 90% EV's with a market share of 18% for Tesla, so in other countries sales will most likely not decline as much in the same period since oversaturation is less of an issue. Norway can be a reference for other markets in the future but only if Tesla is able to clean up their reputation.

Since administration only started on the 21st, we will only see the real effect of decline in sales when numbers from March are published. Some other countries share car registrations which are from a time point a view much more reliable than sales, since it's unclear if this is about cars being delivered or ordered.

**Reasons of decline**

* (stronger) competition
* oversaturation of Tesla, people want to have another car as the rest
* customers possibly waiting for new Tesla Y 
* Musk

Although oversaturation is less of a risk in other countries, people still steer away from Tesla in favour of different, fresher designs. Tesla is focusing a lot on new tech gadgets/software, while their cars still almost look the same as many years ago.

**Conclusion and near future**

Although it's unclear if the numbers are deliveries or orders in February, we might see a further decline. People that  already decided to buy a Tesla are unlikely to cancel their order. In Norway we might see almost no sales anymore because until new Tesla Y rolls out. In other countries sales could plunge the same as in Norway.

If the decline of sales becomes a trend this will in the short term become a big logistic and manufactoring problem for Tesla. They'll have to start dealing with overstock, production might need to be halted since more production might just lead to more overstock.",2025-03-03 14:57:50,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j2khkm/tesla_sales_plunges_70_in_norway_what_might_the/

1j19zlc,Serious question: why do people think Tesla will survive?,"This isn't a highly technical question, but I think it is critical all the same. Why do people think Tesla will survive Musk?

Tesla is already grossly, wildly inflated beyond any other car company--and yes, it's still a car company--and has spent years failing to deliver FSD. That's starting to become a very, very large problem.

And Musk has now deeply and irrevocably alienated some 10-50% of potential investors and customers, some of whom were previously diehard Tesla fans. Those people are never buying a Tesla product. Ever. And you might think they are overreacting, or the salutes where just ""Roman,"" etc., but none of it changes the fact that they are forever boycotting Tesla.

The only two bullish arguments I can think of are, first, that Musk will create such uniquely amazing technology that everyone will forgive his indiscretions. But even if Musk has some unique, amazing magically technology--which he doesn't--who is going to use it? If Hitler has a monopoly on magic carpets, you don't reluctantly buy one. You just walk. Because if you buy the carpet, everyone else is going to think you're a Nazi. Even if you fire Hitler, no one is going to buy magic carpets from former Nazi carpet merchants, not for a very long time at least. And Tesla doesn't even have a monopoly. It's pretty far behind in some key areas.

The second argument would be that his affiliation with Trump will forever protect Tesla stock price. But Trump doesn't have a trillion dollars to give Musk, not that he would, and government largess isn't going to get you very far with extremely limited customers and investors.

So what's the case I'm missing here? Why wouldn't you short the hell out of this stock?

Edit: Thanks for the feedback, this has been productive. The best answer I'm seeing is that Tesla can get rid of Musk once he starts hurting the bottom line. That's a logical line of thought, but I think it is already too late. We shall see when and if it happens.

Edit 2: Friends, you don't have to do this, but please don't think Tesla will just be able to wash all of this with the right PR team and a new CEO. This isn't like Anheuser-Busch having a bad quarter because of a trans model. Tesla and its board apparently let a \*\*\*\* remain CEO. That's on Tesla, not just Musk. ""Never forget"" means never forget.

Edit 3: For stats: [32% of US car buyers today would not consider a Tesla versus only 17% in 2021](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/02/17/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk-politics); [Tesla favorability perception drops from 33% in 2018 to 9% by Jan. 2024 to 3% in Jan. 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-sales-elon-musk-reputation-brand-damage-trump-doge/); [Tesla ranks least favorable among consumers interested in buying an EV](https://insideevs.com/news/749741/tesla-ev-buyers-favorability-rating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); [Republicans like Musk but 48% don't like EVs](https://www.newsweek.com/republican-change-tune-elon-musk-not-tesla-2029028); [60% of UK car buyers refuse to consider a Tesla](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/30/uk-survey-finds-60-of-car-buyers-turned-off-by-elon-musk/); [one in three Dutch Tesla owners want to sell](https://insideevs.com/news/747944/tesla-owners-musk-survey-netherlands/), etc.

Those are brutal numbers. And maybe all of that damage can heal if Musk ever gets ousted. But with tightening competition, there's a point of no return.

Edit 4: Ok, so hard no on the ""but it isn't a car company"" angle. About 88-93% of Tesla's revenue is tied to automotive, meaning  it's actually more of a car company than other car companies, like, say, Volkswagen (15% financial services). Or BYD, which is \~80% automotive with the rest being electronics, energy, batteries, and semiconductors. So basically its a better Tesla.  And Tesla isn't a tech/AI/robot/home company for the same reason that McDonald's isn't: neither of them sell those products.

A really weak point, almost impossible to overcome, is the way the cars are manufactured. The focus has been on building profitable cars, some of them huge in parts, which can seem very efficient, profitable and good for the investor. The problem is that these cars need to travel on the road and it is very easy to have an accident, even a minor one.  Large and small Tesla customers are realizing this. A small dent could lead to an accident and the car not being worth repairing.

1izooi2,Some DD on European Defense Companies,"# Major European Defense Companies

# BAE Systems (UK)

* **Performance:**¬†BAE Systems saw¬†**sales grew 14% to ¬£28.3 billion**¬†in 2024, with underlying EBIT rising \~12%. EPS also increased from 63.2p to 68.5p, reflecting strong execution and higher profitability.
* **Backlog & Contracts:**¬†The company‚Äôs¬†**record-high backlog of ¬£77.8 billion**¬†(up 11% YoY) represents nearly three years of revenue visibility. It secured ¬£33.7 billion in new orders, including significant contracts related to the AUKUS submarine pact and Eurofighter program.
* **Geopolitical Tailwinds:**¬†With the UK increasing defense spending beyond 2% of GDP, BAE stands to benefit from ongoing investment in combat aircraft, naval ships, and nuclear submarines. It's previously been described as having¬†**""the keys to the back door of Number 10 \[Downing Street\]""**
* **Valuation:**¬†Currently trading at¬†**21√ó earnings**¬†(historical average \~14√ó), with a¬†**1.5√ó P/S ratio and EV/EBITDA around 12‚Äì14√ó**. While some growth is priced in, there remains room for upside if European defense budgets continue expanding.

# Thales (France)

* **Performance:**¬†Thales reported¬†**record-high order intake of ‚Ç¨23.1 billion**¬†in 2023, lifting its¬†**backlog to ‚Ç¨47 billion**¬†by mid-2024. Sales grew \~5%, with EBIT up \~10%, demonstrating strong operational performance.
* **Backlog & Contracts:**¬†The company secured several contracts exceeding ‚Ç¨500 million each, including deals for Rafale fighter systems, air defense radars, and a major 10-year French defense cloud project.
* **Geopolitical Factors:**¬†With France increasing military spending and the EU pushing for greater defense self-sufficiency, Thales is well positioned in aerospace, cyber-security, and defense electronics.
* **Valuation:**¬†Thales trades at a¬†**P/E of 28√ó and an EV/EBITDA of 13‚Äì15√ó**, higher than historical norms, suggesting much of the expected growth is might be reflected in its stock price.

# Leonardo (Italy)

* **Performance:**¬†Leonardo posted¬†**double-digit growth in 2024**, with¬†**revenues up 11% to ‚Ç¨17.8 billion**¬†and EBITA rising 13%.
* **Backlog & Contracts:**¬†Its¬†**order backlog now exceeds ‚Ç¨44 billion**, with strong bookings for helicopters, Eurofighter Typhoon exports, and defense electronics.
* **Growth Drivers:**¬†As Italy increases defense spending toward NATO‚Äôs 2% target, Leonardo is set to benefit from major defense programs. Additionally, its ownership of Leonardo DRS provides access to U.S. military contracts.
* **Valuation:**¬†Still trading at¬†**20√ó earnings and only \~1√ó sales**, despite it's recent impressive runup, Leonardo appears to still be undervalued compared to peers. If it continues improving margins and cash flow, there is¬†**significant room for multiple expansion**.

# Rheinmetall (Germany)

* **Performance:**¬†Rheinmetall transformed into a¬†**rapidly growing pure-play defense leader**, with¬†**sales up 30‚Äì40% and profits doubling**¬†in 2023.
* **Backlog & Contracts:**¬†The company‚Äôs¬†**order backlog soared to ‚Ç¨52 billion by Q3 2024**, nearly five times its annual revenue. Major wins include a¬†**‚Ç¨8.5 billion artillery ammunition deal**, a¬†**‚Ç¨3.5 billion military truck order**, and expanding production in air defense and armored vehicles.
* **Geopolitical Momentum:**¬†Germany‚Äôs ‚Ç¨100 billion defense modernization effort provides a long-term growth runway for Rheinmetall, particularly in armored vehicles, artillery, and munitions.
* **Valuation:**¬†The stock trades at over¬†**80√ó earnings,**¬†with an insane recent run. While its backlog supports long-term growth,¬†**valuation risk is high**. I'd probably wait for a pullback on this one but what do I know, I wouldn't have bought Tesla either.

# Saab AB (Sweden)

* **Performance:**¬†Saab delivered¬†**23% organic sales growth**¬†in 2024, with¬†**EBIT up 32% and revenue reaching SEK 63.7 billion (\~$6.2 billion)**.
* **Backlog & International Demand:**¬†Its¬†**order backlog grew 22% to SEK 187 billion (\~$17 billion)**, supported by strong exports of anti-tank weapons, radars, and Gripen fighter upgrades.
* **Growth Outlook:**¬†With Sweden increasing defense spending and expanding its NATO role, Saab is well-positioned. Demand for its Carl-Gustaf anti-armor weapons and air defense radars continues to surge.
* **Valuation:**¬†Saab trades at¬†**35‚Äì40√ó earnings**, above its historical average (\~23√ó). While it has strong international demand, much of its near-term growth is already priced in.

# Hensoldt (Germany)

* **Specializes in defense electronics (radars, optronics, electronic warfare).**
* **Backlog of ‚Ç¨6.64 billion**¬†(up 20% YoY).
* **Revenue grew 21% in 2024**; targets ‚Ç¨5 billion annually by 2030.
* **Undervalued vs peers despite critical role in surveillance & air defense.**

# QinetiQ Group (UK)

* **Provides defense R&D, robotics, and test & evaluation services.**
* **Backlog of ¬£2.9 billion**, growing internationally.

# Kongsberg Gruppen (Norway)

* **Leading missile and air defense supplier in Europe.**
* **Backlog of NOK 88 billion (\~$8.5 billion).**
* **Major supplier of NASAMS air defense system and Naval Strike Missile.**
* **Strong growth potential as NATO nations standardize on its weapons.**
* **Increased Arctic military interest could mean it's a good speculative Arctic play**

# Conclusion/Outlook

With¬†**record order backlogs and rising military budgets**, European defence is likely to see a rather¬†**significant boom**. Fears of a complete¬†**NATO collapse aside**, EU leaders including¬†**Macron and Germany's new chancellor**¬†are increasingly open and pushing for a¬†**European army**, as it's clear the age of reliance on US defence is coming to an end. I'm going to be creating a mini-etf with these stocks (allocations pending) and seeing how they perform over the next few years.

**TLDR**:

* **Leonardo and BAE Systems**¬†appear¬†**undervalued**¬†relative to their peers.
* **Thales, Saab, and Rheinmetall**¬†have strong growth, but their stocks already reflect much of the upside.
* **Smaller players like Hensoldt, QinetiQ, and Chemring**¬†could offer better risk-reward opportunities.

Given the rapid evolution of defense spending,¬†**selecting stocks with solid backlogs and reasonable valuations**¬†will be key to capturing underappreciated upside.",2025-02-27 19:49:25,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izooi2/some_dd_on_european_defense_companies/
1iznm3n,"Tesla seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, Bloomberg News reports","Tesla is seeking approval to offer ride-hailing services in California, a key step by Elon Musk's company to begin carrying paying customers while its traditional car-selling business falters, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.

The automaker has approval to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California, but it does not have, nor has applied for, a driver-less testing or deployment permit from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, according to the report.

Tesla late last year applied for a transportation charter-party carrier permit from the California Public Utilities Commission, the report said, citing documents. That classification means Tesla would own and control the fleet of vehicles.

The company discussed driver's license information and drug-testing coordination in its communications with California officials, suggesting that Tesla intends to use human drivers, at least initially, the report said.

Tesla and the California Public Utilities Commission did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Musk has in the past year pivoted Tesla to robotaxis as demand slows for its aging line-up of electric vehicles ‚Äî a high-stakes bet that has lifted shares but could face regulatory roadblocks. Investors are counting on the billionaire's close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump to simplify that process.

Musk had in October said Tesla will roll out driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year, without offering more specific details.

Tesla had in the same month revealed a concept for a robotaxi called Cybercab that will come without a steering wheel or control pedals, as it looks to dominate the self-driving vehicle industry.

Musk has said Tesla will start fully unsupervised FSD in Texas and California this year, without offering more details. He said the Cybercab will go into production in 2026 and will also be available for customers to buy for less than $30,000.

However, with autonomous technology proving harder and more expensive to solve, industry experts have warned it could take Tesla several years to commercialize a robotaxi.

1izi0k0,Reddit picks winners!,"Year after year Reddit picks the winners! I have kept a close eye on this subreddit for the last 10-15 years and have always been amazed by how ahead of the curve we are. Here is a list of stocks that have been heavily discussed over the years that have performed very well: 

- Tesla 
- Shopify 
- Block
- NVDA 
- AMD 
- PLTR
- AAPL 
- GME

I know everyone in the comments is going to claim this is selection bias, but I can assure you these stocks were talked about so much it is unmistakable. People will also claim but these stocks have tanked since then! They have had significant corrections, but if you bought them when the buzz began you are still significantly in the green.  We will have to wait and see what the future holds. 

 But what about the losers like movie pass!? Of course, some losers have been overly hyped too, but they are far less common. Also, in my opinion, the tone around stocks like movie pass is totally different than a stock like NVDA or SHOP. 

The beautiful part about Reddit is you hear both sides, SHOP had a great deal of resistance back in 2017 and still does. A lot of people claimed it was a worthless company. People like Andrew Left were worshipped for shorting the company. But at the end of the day it was posted about non stop and has performed extremely well. People were also screaming from the top of the mountain that NVDA was overpriced in 2017, look where that ended up. 

Lately it feels like we have entered a new ‚Äúhype‚Äù cycle where a lot of new names have been heavily mentioned. Similar to the hype cycle of 2016-2017 there is a lot of resistance and great discussions behind had. Here are some new names that I have noticed being posted about non stop: 

- RKLB
- IONQ 
- BBAI
- CAVA 
- LUNR
- SMCI
- OKLO 
- BRO

I have been seeing these tickers fly around lately and see a lot of promise in them. They have performed very well in the past 6 months to a year, but we will have to wait and see where they end up in the long term. 

It‚Äôs a common meme to short every stock Reddit mentions, but I ultimately disagree. The hive mind is a very powerful and can seemingly predict the future. Keep in mind, the hive mind is what sets the vegas spreads. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs my rant for the day. I am sure 75% of you will disagree with me, but again, thats why I love Reddit. Would love to hear your opinions. 

Also, I have holdings in most of the companies listed. This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence before buying any company I listed. ",2025-02-27 15:13:55,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1izi0k0/reddit_picks_winners/
1izfnba,Nvidia‚Äôs auto segment revenue surges to record high on demand for driver-assist tech,"U.S. chipmaker¬†Nvidia‚Äôs auto segment revenue more than doubled in the latest quarter to a record high on strong demand for driver-assist software.

While the company‚Äôs biggest revenue stream by far is chip systems that power artificial intelligence, Nvidia has predicted its products that power driver-assist technology could become its next ‚Äúbillion-dollar‚Äù business.

Revenue of Nvidia‚Äôs¬†automotive and robotics segment¬†rose 103% year on year to $570 million in the fourth quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. That brought the segment‚Äôs revenue for the fiscal year to $1.69 billion, above $1 billion for a second-straight year.

The latest increase in revenue was due to to sales of Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúself-driving platforms,‚Äù according to the company‚Äôs¬†CFO.

‚ÄúThis growth highlights Nvidia‚Äôs increasing exposure to powering ADAS, autonomous vehicles, and robotics through its DRIVE platform and related technologies,‚Äù Brady Wang, semiconductor analyst at Counterpoint Research, said in an email.

CEO Jensen Huang said in Nvidia‚Äôs earnings call the company expects that ‚Äúevery single one‚Äù of the 1 billion cars on the roads today ‚Äúwill be robotic cars‚Äù that collect data which Nvidia-supported AI systems can help refine, according to a FactSet transcript.

Automotive and robotics is ‚Äúgetting ready to take off,‚Äù likely due to investments in autonomous vehicles such as Waymo and¬†Tesla, Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in an email. Munster also estimated that around 15 companies are building humanoid robots, potentially increasing demand for Nvidia chips.

‚ÄúThe performance of that segment is an important story below the fold that‚Äôs not getting much attention because it‚Äôs small,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúbut they can be a much bigger part of revenue going forward.‚Äù

Autos and robotics unit currently accounts for 1.45% of Nvidia‚Äôs total revenue.

Counterpoint‚Äôs Wang expects this growth to continue with Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúincreasing adoption of L2+ and more advanced systems‚Äù.

Several Chinese electric car companies, including BYD, Nio and Zeekr, use Nvidia‚Äôs driver-assist chip systems.

‚ÄúIn addition to autonomous driving, I also anticipate that robotics and physical AI will experience a hype,‚Äù Wang added, ‚Äúfollowed by real-world applications in the coming years, sustaining the long-term growth of this sector.‚Äù

**NVDA earnings today, will likely decide the fate of the immediate market. It reports at 4:20 ET today!**

News: [China Plans To Start Bank Capital Hike With At Least 55 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/china-plans-to-start-bank-capital-hike-with-at-least-55-billion)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)/All Semiconductor Stocks/SMH

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Related Tickers:** INTC, QCOM, ASML

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China‚Äôs six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced¬†allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

1iyjv2c,Why I Went All-In on Tesla and maybe you should too ‚Äì The Future is Here,"I know a lot of people are out here chasing ""value stocks"" and ""strong fundamentals,"" but I‚Äôve decided to take a different approach. After hours of deep research (watching a few YouTube videos and scrolling Twitter), I realized something: Tesla isn‚Äôt just a car company ‚Äì it‚Äôs a movement.

First, let‚Äôs talk about Elon Musk. You might think he‚Äôs just a billionaire meme lord, but I see him as the closest thing to a modern-day prophet. Every time he tweets, markets move. That‚Äôs power. And if you don‚Äôt see the value in that, I don‚Äôt know what to tell you.

Second, the balance sheet? Who cares. Numbers are for accountants. Tesla doesn‚Äôt operate like a traditional business because it‚Äôs not a traditional business. It‚Äôs a tech company, an AI powerhouse, a battery innovator, a space exploration partner, and probably the future of teleportation if we‚Äôre being honest. Legacy automakers? They're still making cars. Tesla is building the infrastructure for a new civilization.

Then there‚Äôs the stock split phenomenon. Every time Tesla splits, it just‚Ä¶ goes up. I don‚Äôt know why, I don‚Äôt need to know why. It just does. Some people say stock splits don‚Äôt create value‚Äîwell, tell that to my brokerage account.

Let‚Äôs not forget Full Self-Driving. The haters love to point out that FSD isn‚Äôt fully autonomous yet. But real investors understand that it‚Äôs about the vision. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs ready this year, next year, or in 2045. The fact that it‚Äôs coming is enough. I don‚Äôt need my car to drive itself today‚ÄîI need the stock to keep going up.

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs simple: Tesla is not just a stock. It‚Äôs a lifestyle. It‚Äôs a mindset. It‚Äôs a culture. And if you don‚Äôt see that, well, have fun with your little index funds.

1iycoxa,Tesla‚Äôs market cap sinks below $1 trillion as stock slumps more than 8%,"Tesla‚Äôs¬†postelection pop has almost disappeared.

Shares of the electric vehicle maker plunged more than 8% on Tuesday, pushing the company‚Äôs market cap below $1 trillion and to its lowest since Nov. 7, which was two days after¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs¬†election victory.

The stock has plummeted 25% to start the year, while the Nasdaq is down just 1.5%, and has slid more than 35% from its record close on Dec. 16. CEO¬†Elon Musk¬†has lost more than $100 billion in net worth over that stretch, though he is still the world‚Äôs richest person, with a fortune valued at about $380 billion.

The latest slide followed a report from¬†Reuters¬†on Monday that Tesla‚Äôs long-awaited upgrade to its partially automated driving systems left owners disappointed. Many users told the publication that Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúnavigate on city streets‚Äù feature in China fell short of Musk‚Äôs promises for self-driving technology.

Other EV makers in China, including¬†BYD, offer their partially automated driving systems for free or a much lower cost. Xiaomi‚Äôs popular model SU7 includes the company‚Äôs equivalent technology as a standard option for free.

The report out of China added to anxiety among Tesla shareholders. Some of the concern has to do with the company‚Äôs performance and some is specific to Musk, who is spending much of his time in Washington, D.C., leading President Trump‚Äôs so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.

Musk, along with his team in Washington, has gained unparalleled access to government computer systems and taxpayer data, and the president has enabled the billionaire to lead mass firings of workers in agencies tasked with oversight of his companies, including Tesla.

Musk‚Äôs extremist political rhetoric and activism has led opponents in various markets to organize¬†protests, including at Tesla stores and service centers. Tesla‚Äôs stock dropped¬†earlier this month¬†on Trump‚Äôs announced plans for extensive tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which came alongside a decline in Tesla vehicle registrations across Europe in January and February.

For the fourth quarter, Tesla¬†reported¬†earnings and sales that missed analysts‚Äô estimates, with automotive revenue dropping 8% from a year earlier and operating income plummeting 23%. In the late January report, the company cited reduced average selling prices across its aging lineup of Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X vehicles as a major reason for the decline.

According to the California New Car Dealers Association, Tesla sales dropped 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the state, which had been Tesla‚Äôs biggest market domestically.

Tesla shares are now about 20% above where they were trading prior to Trump‚Äôs victory. Most of what remains of the rally is due to the stock‚Äôs¬†15% jump¬†the day after the election. Musk¬†was a major backer of Trump‚Äôs presidential effort, contributing $290 million to Republican candidates and causes in 2024, with most of that directed at returning Trump to the White House.

1iy5new,Tesla sales in Europe down 45% in January,"Tesla sales plummeted in Europe in January, suggesting waning demand for the US carmaker‚Äôs vehicles after its billionaire chief Elon Musk stepped up his high-profile interventions in the region‚Äôs politics.

The EV maker sold just 9,900 units in Europe last month, a decline of more than 45 per cent from the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers‚Äô Association. Its overall share of new car registrations fell to 1 per cent from 1.8 per cent over the same period.

Tesla‚Äôs falling market share comes after Musk‚Äôs unprecedented foray into EU politics, where he backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of the country‚Äôs elections, sparking a backlash on the continent. Musk has also railed against the EU, which he described in November as ‚Äúundemocratic‚Äù.

The fall came even as European consumers purchased 166,000 battery EVs for the month, up 37 per cent from a year ago. Pure EV sales grew faster than those of all other types of vehicles, while sales of cars with petrol and diesel engines fell 20.5 per cent and 26.5 per cent, respectively.

The figures include the EU, UK and other markets including Norway, one of Europe‚Äôs biggest markets for EVs.

European sales by SAIC Motor, the Chinese state-backed carmaker that has expanded into the EU and partnered with Audi in China, rose 37 per cent to 23,000 vehicles in January, among the largest year-on-year increases in sales of any large manufacturer in the region.

Overall new vehicle registrations on the continent fell by 2.1 per cent in January to 995,271.

> Elon Musk's automaker has come under increasing pressure in the world's largest car market from local EV giant BYD and its rivals, who are now competitive with the Model Y manufacturer on both price and technology.

> In January, BYD sold nearly double the number of EVs as Tesla, with the US carmaker's sales slumping by 11% from the previous year.

As the world sours on America, American products (including cars), and Tesla - BYD can gain from Trump's 2nd term. It has gone up by almost 40% since Trump came into office. With Tesla sales dropping all over the world, BYD is one of the carmakers that are poised to fill that void. And because they do not sell cars in the US, they have 0 exposure in the American market so they are immune from Trump's tariffs. They have a lot to gain from Trump's presidency and very little to lose. ",2025-02-20 22:12:12,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iuayic/byd_and_its_rivals_are_crushing_tesla_in_china/
1itncot,"Palantir plunges after CEO Karp changes share sales plan, Pentagon budget cut report","The share price of¬†Palantir¬†fell as much as 12.5% Wednesday after news that CEO Alex Karp had adopted a new stock trading plan, and a¬†report¬†that the Pentagon has been ordered to prepare to cut the U.S. defense budget by 8% each year for the next five years.

Palantir is best known for its contracting work providing¬†software¬†and technology services for defense agencies.

On Tuesday night, Palantir in a¬†regulatory filing¬†disclosed that Karp‚Äôs new plan will allow him to sell nearly 10 million shares of company stock in the next six months.

The Washington Post¬†on Wednesday said Defense Secretary¬†Pete Hegseth¬†has ordered senior Pentagon leaders and other military brass to develop plans to slash the defense budget over the next half decade. The budget for the current fiscal year is around $850 billion.

The Post reported that Hegseth ordered the proposed cuts to be drawn up by Monday.

Palantir closed trading Wednesday at $112.06 per share, a drop of 10%. Shares were down more than 1.5% in after-hours trading.

The company, whose market capitalization tops $255 billion, in early February reported $828 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, with adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share.

Before Wednesday‚Äôs abrupt drop, Palantir had been one of the top-performing stocks in the U.S. for the last two years, including a share price rise of nearly 50% in the year to date.

Palantir trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 600-to-1.

The Trump administration has been engaged in a wide-ranging effort to slash government spending and the number of federal government workers since President¬†Donald Trump¬†was inaugurated for a second nonconsecutive term on Jan. 20.

Trump appointed Tesla CEO Elon Musk to oversee that effort, dubbed the ‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency.‚Äù

Musk and Trump have come under fire for their methods in achieving DOGE‚Äôs goal, with some steps being challenged successfully in federal court.

On Tuesday, Karp, who co-founded the company with Peter Thiel, defended Musk during an appearance on CNBC‚Äôs¬†‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the progressive left should be doing is saying, ‚ÄòOK, Elon, you‚Äôre clearly the most qualified person in the world to do something like this. We want a dialog with you about what you‚Äôre doing, how you‚Äôre doing,‚Äô‚Äù Karp said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs happened,‚Äù he added.

1iq3s4q,How Musk is using TSLA as a piggy bank,"Everyone knows it is a meme stock. By definition it would crash at some point. The trick is to make money while not ending up being the bag holder when it crashes.

But the stock won‚Äôt crash unless Musk starts selling. And he knows it too. So he is using the meme stock and meme coins as collateral to invest in real companies that actually have some realistic valuation. 

Musk sold $8.5 billion in Tesla shares to buy Twitter. The stock went down. He basically converted the meme stock to a real company. The banks underwrote that investment suffered losses but he used Twitter to buy the presidency. The banks lost money but gained favors like less regulations instead. Everyone is happy.

He contracts out TSLA stuff to his private companies like xAi.  XAi and Optimus have huge conflicts of interest. Both of them need the best AI talents. My guess is Optimus will end up being the hardware side of the business(nuts and bolts assembly) while the software and IPs will belong to XAi. And for every robot sold, there will be a license paid to XAi. If the board removes Musk, the licensing fee will go up making TSLA side of the business virtually worthless.

I am pretty sure the big investment banks know these things but they are given investment opportunities in his private businesses in exchange for their silence and their inflated analyst valuations. And they don‚Äôt want to shoot themselves in the foot having lent him huge sums of money.

People say Musk won‚Äôt let TSLA down because most of his wealth is tied to it. At this point he is milking TSLA for what it is worth. He is borrowing against inflated meme stock prices to buy real companies that are private. He is hedging against the inevitable TSLA crash. His lenders are going with the Ponzi scheme to mitigate the risk to their massive investment. Having borrowed heavily against TSLA shares Musk has no incentive to work for TSLA anymore.

If I have sizable TSLA holdings I would be nervously watching his latest  and totally random OpenAI cash offer of $98 billion or a potential tik tok bid. That means the stock will crater again if he sells stock, he may not care because by now he knows the game is up. Maybe it is triggered by BYD offering free FSD on 20k cars. And this time there might be no coming back. He might offer you first dibs on SpaceX ipo for holding worthless TSLA shares but it sure won‚Äôt be cheap.

Disclosure: I don‚Äôt have any positions on TSLA at this point.

1ipetzp,Meta plans major investment into AI-powered humanoid robots,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html)

Meta Platforms Inc., after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.

The company is making a significant investment into the category ‚Äî futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks ‚Äî and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn‚Äôt been announced.

Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesn‚Äôt plan to build a Meta-branded robot ‚Äî something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.‚Äôs Optimus ‚Äî but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.

The humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.‚Äôs Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

‚ÄúThe core technologies we‚Äôve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,‚Äù Andrew Bosworth, Meta‚Äôs chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the company‚Äôs advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.

Meta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta‚Äôs advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.

‚ÄúWe believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,‚Äù Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.

Meta‚Äôs goal is to provide what Google‚Äôs Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.‚Äôs chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.

The software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.

Meta has been investing billions of dollars for years into its Reality Labs hardware division, which sells products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta plans to spend $65 billion this year on related products, including artificial intelligence infrastructure and the new robot work.",2025-02-14 16:44:21,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ipetzp/meta_plans_major_investment_into_aipowered/

1iojaoh,Apple‚Äôs Stock-Market Performance Is Increasingly Made in China,"* Country is both a significant market and key production hub
* Apple has underperformed other Big Tech stocks this year

>Investors in America‚Äôs biggest company are increasingly focused on China, where¬†Apple Inc.¬†is striving to win over a crucial customer base while also facing tariff-related risks.

>The iPhone maker counts China as a significant market and a major manufacturing hub. If it improves its¬†flagging sales¬†in the country with artificial intelligence features in its devices, that could be a key catalyst to revive the investment case. On the other hand, tariffs and the prospect of an escalating trade war represent risks of unknown magnitude.

>Read:¬†Apple‚Äôs China Focus Thrusts It Into Center of Geopolitical Fight

>‚ÄúApple‚Äôs level of exposure to China is a risk relative to much of the rest of the market,‚Äù said¬†Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. The prospect of Apple being in the crosshairs of tariffs or investigations should be on investors‚Äô radars, he said.

>‚ÄúHowever, if AI iPhones are a success, that could mean steady growth over the next several years,‚Äù he added.

>The shares are down 5.4% in 2025, making Apple the¬†worst performer¬†among the Magnificent 7 except for Tesla Inc. Sentiment has soured in recent months, with tepid demand for the iPhone 16 ‚Äî the first to incorporate AI features ‚Äî and tariff risks weighing. The company‚Äôs recent results were¬†mixed, featuring disappointing China and iPhone sales, though the forecast was seen as encouraging.

>Improving China sales would be significant. Apple got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to¬†data¬†compiled by Bloomberg, compared with about 26% for Europe and more than 40% for the Americas.

>The potential for improved trends in China was demonstrated this week, when Apple jumped on a broadly negative day for markets following a¬†report¬†that it has started working with¬†Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.¬†to bring AI features to Apple products in China. The Chinese firm‚Äôs chairman¬†confirmed the partnership¬†on Thursday.

>‚ÄúWe would view this as a critical catalyst for Apple‚Äôs competitive standing in China,‚Äù Morgan Stanley analyst¬†Erik Woodring¬†wrote earlier this week. Citing a survey the firm conducted, he added that Chinese iPhone users are more interested in AI than US or European peers, and that more than 50% said the staggered roll out of Apple Intelligence had ‚Äúa moderate to significant impact on their decision not to upgrade to a new iPhone this cycle.‚Äù

>Any improvement would also come after a period of muted growth compared with Big Tech peers. Apple‚Äôs revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.9% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.6% pace¬†expected¬†for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

>Within this context, geopolitical tensions loom large. The Trump administration¬†imposed¬†10% tariffs against China, and the country¬†retaliated¬†with tariffs of its own. China is also¬†weighing¬†a potential probe into Apple‚Äôs policies and App Store fees.

>Analysts are so far downplaying the risk of tariffs, though they note uncertainties like how long they might be in place and whether Apple will get an exemption. Evercore ISI¬†sees¬†an impact ‚Äúin the range of 3-4% of EPS,‚Äù which it described as ‚Äúrelatively minimal.‚Äù Bank of America said the¬†impact¬†on earnings should be ‚Äúlimited‚Äù and ‚Äúmanageable.‚Äù

>Still, Apple‚Äôs valuation suggests limited room for error. Shares trade at 31 times estimated earnings, roughly 50% above their average over the past decade. The stock also trades at a premium to the broader market and the overall tech sector.

>Following multiple¬†downgrades¬†this year, just over 60% of analysts recommend buying the stock, a rate well below megacaps like Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., or Meta Platforms Inc.

>Still, investors continue to view Apple as a relatively defensive stock given its strong cash flow, massive buyback program, high-margin services business, and a lack of heavy spending on AI.

>‚ÄúApple looks a little problematic in the short term given the valuation and the lack of growth, but you‚Äôre not going to find a more impressive cash-cow of a company,‚Äù said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason it remains an institutional and retail favorite.‚Äù

2. Model 3: A mid-size sedan designed to be more affordable while maintaining performance and range.


3. Model X: A mid-size luxury SUV featuring falcon-wing doors and seating configurations for up to seven passengers.


4. Model Y: A mid-size crossover SUV available in five- and seven-passenger configurations. A redesigned version, known as the ""Juniper"" Model Y, was introduced in early 2025, featuring updated exterior and interior designs.

6. Semi: A Class 8 semi-truck designed for cargo transport, with initial deliveries starting in December 2022.

üåç New Political & Tariff Risks ‚Äì Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



‚ö° Serious Competition is Catching Up ‚Äì Tesla isn‚Äôt the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching‚Äîor surpassing‚Äîthem in innovation.



üö¶ FSD is Overhyped ‚Äì Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla‚Äôs self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



üîã Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze ‚Äì Raw material costs are going up, and Trump‚Äôs tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



ü§ñ Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent ‚Äì Even before Musk‚Äôs latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla‚Äôs AI progress.



üîµ Losing Left-Leaning Consumers ‚Äì Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs‚Äîthey were miles ahead of everyone else. But that‚Äôs just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.

I believe it will go down more because of many reasons everyone here probably knows. Increased competetion in China market, Europe sales are going down for multitude of reasons, tariffs on so many car building materials and Elon himself.

1ilf3sk,I want to invest in $UBER - help,"
Been researching Uber as a potential investment and wanted to share my thoughts about the risks and upside to make sure im not missing anything.

Uber‚Äôs current valuation seems disconnected from its fundamentals. It trades at a P/E of ~16x 2025 earnings, lower than DoorDash (~40x) and the broader market. Free cash flow jumped to $6.9B in 2024, and analysts expect $7.7B in 2025, i think the stock hasn‚Äôt fully priced this in. There‚Äôs also optionality in hidden assets like its stakes in Waymo and Fairfax India‚Äôs Bangalore Airport, which could unlock billions if those companies go public.  

Management has been aggressive with buybacks ($7B program) and debt reduction, cutting net debt/EBITDA to 1.2x. They‚Äôre reinvesting in growth areas like autonomous vehicles (partnering with Waymo and Tesla) and Uber One subscriptions, which already drive 35% of gross bookings. Advertising revenue is a sleeper hit‚Äîit grew 80% last year and could hit a $5B annual run rate by 2026.  

Near-term catalysts include a $1.5B accelerated buyback and possible S&P 500 inclusion. Long-term, AV adoption could add $12B EBITDA by 2030. 

Risks? AV delays or regulatory hurdles, but at 1.2x P/B and $9B cash (~10% of market cap), downside feels capped. Upside to $115+ seems plausible if execution continues.  

What am I missing? Are AV partnerships overhyped, or is Uber positioning itself as the aggregator?  How sustainable is the advertising growth with competition from DoorDash/Lyft? Does the cash cushion and buyback program make this a safer play in a shaky macro?  

Would love to hear others‚Äô takes.

1ik4nfq,Chinese Markets are Rejecting Tesla,"Tesla‚Äôs dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to a new report from CNBC, Tesla‚Äôs sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It‚Äôs not just a sales dip, it‚Äôs a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla‚Äôs profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla‚Äôs core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China‚Äôs policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

Tesla‚Äôs Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations, cut subsidies, or tilt the playing field even further in favor of domestic competitors, any of which would weaken Tesla‚Äôs foothold even more.

Elon‚Äôs strategy of constant price cuts has helped sustain demand, but the latest 11.5% sales drop suggests the approach is losing its effectiveness. Cutting prices again and again doesn‚Äôt build brand loyalty.. It signals that demand is slipping.

And Tesla can‚Äôt keep squeezing its margins forever. The competition isn‚Äôt slowing down it‚Äôs accelerating.",2025-02-07 20:21:19,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ik4nfq/chinese_markets_are_rejecting_tesla/
1ik062b,Tesla car sales in China fall 11.5% as competition intensifies,"Sales of¬†Tesla‚Äôs cars to China fell in January, as competition from domestic rivals continued to heat up.

Tesla sold 63,238 units of its electric cars in January, down 11.5% from the 71,447 cars sold in the same month last year.

Shares of Tesla were down about 1.5% in premarket trading.

Chinese rival¬†BYD¬†meanwhile sold 296,446 pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles last month, up 47% year-on-year.

Other Chinese rivals of Tesla, including Changan Automobile and Xpeng, also posted growth in sales.

Tesla has attempted to use price cuts as an incentive to retain Chinese‚Äô buyers interest in its car. Late last year, Tesla¬†slashed the price¬†of its Model Y car and also extended a zero-interest five-year loan plan until the end of January.

Last month, the U.S. giant also announced a revamped version of the Model Y ‚Äî one of its best-selling EV autos ‚Äî in China. This also came with a 0% interest plan.

Tesla has not introduced a new model since it began delivering the Cybertruck in late 2023, which starts at nearly $80,000. Investors have been yearning for a new mass-market model from the company to reinvigorate sales.

Tesla has said a new affordable model could be launched in the first half of 2025.

Meanwhile, the automaker is pushing to launch its driver assist system, which it markets as ‚ÄúFull Self Driving,‚Äù in China this year, as rivals also roll out similar features.

1ij89u7,Tesla gears up for Optimus production with hiring push at Fremont factory,"Tesla is taking a big step toward bringing its humanoid robot, Optimus , to life. The company has officially begun hiring for various manufacturing roles at its Fremont Factory in California, signaling that it is preparing for large-scale production of the AI-powered robot.

According to recent job postings on Tesla‚Äôs careers page, the company is looking to build a specialized team dedicated to Optimus production. The company is hiring for a variety of roles, including: (h/t: Sawyer Merritt)

* Manufacturing Engineering Technician, Tesla Bot
* Manufacturing Quality Technician, Tesla Bot
* Manufacturing Process Technician, Tesla Bot
* Production Manager, Tesla Bot
* Process Supervisor, Tesla Bot
* Associate Production Manager, Tesla Bot
* Manufacturing Controls Development Engineer, Tesla Bot
* Production Supervisor, Tesla Bot
* Process Associate Manager, Tesla Bot
* Process Engineer, Tesla Bot
* Manufacturing Equipment Engineer, Tesla Bot
* Quality Engineer, Tesla Bot

Karissa Thein, a Senior Sourcer at Tesla, confirmed the hiring push in a recent post on LinkedIn, saying:

‚ÄúMy team is turning Tesla Bot into a reality! We‚Äôre building Tesla Bot in our Fremont Factory in California, and we‚Äôre looking for engineers up for the challenge of getting this product ramped up for high-volume production.‚Äù 

Tesla unveiled the first working prototype of Optimus in 2022, demonstrating its ability to walk, manipulate objects, and perform basic tasks. The company unveiled the most recent prototype, Gen 2, in late 2023, which has significant advancements in its movements and capabilities compared to previous prototypes. The long-term goal is for the humanoid robot to take on repetitive or dangerous jobs, both in Tesla‚Äôs own factories and in other industries.

During the company‚Äôs Q4 2024 earnings call, Musk said the V1 production line would be able to produce roughly 1,000 units per month. Musk further explained that he expects that line to launch in mid-2026, and the first deliveries of Optimus to companies outside of Tesla will take place in the second half of 2026.

Musk has previously stated that Optimus could be Tesla‚Äôs most important product in the future, even surpassing the company‚Äôs vehicle business in scale with the potential to generate $10 trillion in revenue. With Tesla now actively recruiting engineers and production specialists, it appears that the transition from prototype to practical deployment is well underway.

1ih835v,Tesla‚Äôs Valuation: Speculation or Real Growth? My DCF Insights,"I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here‚Äôs what I found. I don‚Äôt own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&P. However, with recent events, I‚Äôve been wondering why people hold TSLA.

My typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs a way to get started.

For TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.

With these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.

Now, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.

With all that said, it‚Äôs hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?

Congrats to all the long-term holders who have made a killing! I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this.",2025-02-04 03:09:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ih835v/teslas_valuation_speculation_or_real_growth_my/
1ifna8h,Canada will retaliate with 25% tariffs on US imports and limit export of rare minerals as response to Trump tariffs!

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump‚Äôs order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

Canada will also look at how to limit export of rare minerals to the US which are crucial for US tech and car companies like Tesla.

You could Throw in Cisco which has a monopoly over and controls about 66% of the cell phone networking hardware industry in American and it will still be roughly the same. By the way many of the companies on this long list have profit margins and growths that over the last year blow Tesla out of the water. Tesla is not outpacing other companies, other companies are actually catching up to them in the ways they have been growing.

Also, keep in mind that Musk just pissed off about 50 million democrats who were Tesla's existing core customer base. Multiple people at my work who own Tesla's have said they are now embarrassed to own a Tesla.

The speculation is partly based on Tesla's currently nonexistent and delayed automated taxi company. Let's put how weak Tesla's position in perspective.

Tesla plans to open an automated taxi company in Austin Texas this summer. 1 city.  Waymo (owned by Google) started in it's first city 8 years ago and is planning on expanding from 3 cities (San Fransisco, LA, and Pheonix) to 12 over the next year. Tesla is almost a decade behind in this industry and are not in a good position to dominate it or reach fully non city dependent fully automated driving in any way. There is also absolutely no indication that their business model is in a better position than their competitors in this industry currently.

For this current Market cap to be realized, Tesla would essentially need to come to control the majority of 3 major industries while Musk is sitting around playing video games for 12 hours a day (according to him) and playing politician in the Trump administration.",2025-01-31 19:11:51,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iemmrp/psa_teslas_market_cap_is_now_higher_than_the_top/

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China‚Äôs DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> ‚ÄúAs far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn‚Äôt been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,‚Äù Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù
*****
> The Fed‚Äôs interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> ‚ÄúWhen it comes to the Fed, they‚Äôre widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that‚Äôs a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,‚Äù Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell‚Äôs comments ‚Äî his first press conference in President Donald Trump‚Äôs second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump‚Äôs first term. The president has already said he would ‚Äúdemand that interest rates drop immediately.‚Äù

Looking at massive overinflation in stock price, the missed deliveries estimate last quarter, the discounts they had to make on those to make it even close to that number and I cannot see how they beat earnings.

I am pretty confident that a match or slight beat/ miss will cause the stock to correct. I am therefore thinking of taking my modest profit now and selling out of the stock completely. Notwithstanding my feelings on Musk's personal actions.

Recently disclosed text messages reveal that Elon Musk tried to sway Norway‚Äôs massive sovereign wealth fund‚Äîcommonly known as the Oil Fund‚Äîto support his controversial Tesla pay package. The fund, which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla, voted against Musk‚Äôs compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any ‚Äúfavors‚Äù until making amends.

In their exchange, Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund‚Äôs investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway‚Äôs strict transparency laws, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that Musk would not attend.

Initially, the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk‚Äôs calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund‚Äôs legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk‚Äôs pay plan.",2025-01-28 14:20:45,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ic2lgt/elon_musk_tried_to_pressure_norways_wealth_funda/

# [S&P 500 futures are flat as Nvidia attempts to rebound from AI stock rout: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures were relatively unchanged early Tuesday, following a sell-off fueled by worries over the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq 100 futures, traded just above the flatline, rising 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.
*****
> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion ‚Äî the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.
*****
> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech‚Äôs investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple‚Äôs App Store.
*****
> ‚ÄúValuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,‚Äù said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ‚ÄúThe 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.‚Äù
*****
> Investors‚Äô attention is turning toward corporate earnings due this week. Starbucks is due to report Tuesday after the bell. A slate of Magnificent Seven companies will report in the coming days, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple due later this week.
*****
> The Federal Reserve will also kick off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged, according to CMEGroup‚Äôs FedWatch Tool. Inflation data out Friday will give investors further insight on the health of the U.S. economy.

1ib78ft,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",2025-01-27 12:06:13,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ib78ft/the_case_for_tsla_the_business_value/
1i9q788,Deere - has run out of room to run.,"The great American company is trading at a all time high but is facing a lot of headwinds in 2025.

1 Tarriffs - Deere made the mistake of outsourcing their production outside the US and will pay the price with the new administration. They recently announced they were moving production to Mexico for some of the equipment manufacturing which lead to a boycott by farmers and a threat of 200% tariff if they do, which wont happen because you cant really impose this (tariff)tax on a specific company. But this was a mistake by the company because now they spent all this money to setup the factories and production in Mexico but cant really use it as intended.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/)

They also made the mistake of outsourcing tractor production to India. A good amount of production is outside the US, meaning tractors are assembled in India, Europe and elsewhere and sent to the US for sale. Which is a problem because these are not cheap tractors/equipment and someone is going to pay the tariff on foreign goods entering the United States. Not that easy to readjust the whole supply chain back to the US and having to pay people alot more money. Average worker in India makes $5k per year ,in the US these manufacturing jobs will cost maybe $50k-$80k+ per year. Profit margins just got smaller.

Then there is the US manufacturing exports. Deere Exports alot of their products to other countries, not all customers are in the US. If we impose tariffs on lets say German cars coming into the US, they will 100% in retaliation impose tariffs on US cars, heavy equipment and farm equipment being sent into Europe, South America, China, Etc.  Deere isnt the only manufacturer of tractors and farm equipment, you have a lot of manufacturers around the world. People are just going to buy cheaper domestic products.

2 Rumored Pick up truck - There's been a rumor going around they are planning to launch a pick up truck. I think this would be a costly mistake and they just wouldn't be able to compete with the best selling pickup in the world the F-150. Car manufacturing is very expensive as Elon has stressed multiple times, ramping up production costs ALOT of money, and might not be worth the effort, especially if it flops. There is just too much competition is the space between Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Rivian, Nissan, Dodge.

3 FTC sues Deere for Farmers right to repair - The complaint -This unfair steering practice has boosted Deere‚Äôs multi-billion-dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts, growing its repair parts business while burdening farmers with higher repair costs, the FTC‚Äôs complaint alleges.

i dont think this FTC suit is going away, the current administration will 100% stand behind the hard working farmers that feed America. 62% of revenue comes from Agriculture Equipment and 13% comes from financial services. Farmers are using Deere Financing to repair Deere equipment, Its 100% a monopoly.

1i7xv30,Tesla Bullish Upgrade,"Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised Tesla's price target to $550, citing a 'golden era' for Elon Musk under Trump's administration. Despite declining U.S. deliveries and potential policy changes, Ives remains optimistic, setting a bull case target of $650. The potential elimination of EV tax credits and debates around Tesla's Optimus robot program add uncertainty.

1jroid1,Market downturn trigger?,"I scrolled a little bit, and most of what i am seeing on the sub is about tarrifs. Is anyone talking about the impact the downturn of TSLA may have had in precipitating the overall market event? 

I don't currently have access to the information, but i would imagine that a sudden - truly unexpected - drop in a blue chip value stock like TSLA would cause an institutions balance sheet to become very lopsided. I'm thinking the current sell off is due to deleveraging against short positions.

Tarrifs are ugly... political and civil unrest - sure... a bit scary, but that seems to have been fuel to the fire as the match was being lit.

Check my thoughts -  but I truly think EM may have gaffe'd the biggest gaffe that has ever been gaffed. Yes, no? Teslas market cap is down close to half a trillion dollars. That is huge. 

Edits to grammars 

There have been a few comments already. Tarriffs are very, very, very bad and we would be in the same situation whether or not TSLA dipped.

Ok... I see the errors in my thinking

1jreh6b,"CMV: Trump's tariffs are political weapons intentionally designed to create leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.","I've seen a lot of discussion here about why Trump is doing these tariffs. For example, I've seen:    

1. He is doing this to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A.  
2. He is doing this to ""punish"" countries for their tariffs and trade imbalances on and with the U.S.A.   
3. He doesn't know what he's doing, and is dumb and/or short-sighted.  
  
While I see where the logic for these explanations is coming from, I think there is a very real chance that the true explanation is that **Trump's tariffs are a political weapon, designed to give him leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.** By instituting tariffs, rather than just threatening them, now the clock is ticking: countries, industries, and companies are frantically trying to figure out what to do.     
  
Think about it: first, Trump went after universities, threatening to withhold funding unless they caved to his demands about diversity and pro-Palestinian protestors. This has already forced major institutions, like Columbia, to bend the knee to him.  
  
Then, Trump went after big law firms and their clients, threatening through Executive Orders to cut off their access and intimidate them. This has already resulted in major law firms (Paul Weiss and Skadden) to forge ""settlements"" to do free pro bono work to the President's bidding, though luckily some of these firms (Perkins Coie) have had the integrity to fight back and sue.   
  
Following this logic, it follows that Trump with his tariffs doesn't legitimately believe what he is telling the public about his intentions. Far more likely, I think, that he is using these tariffs to force pledges of loyalty, concessions, and ""deals"" with countries, industries, and companies. 

This is not my original idea, to be fair; I heard it from U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D - Connecticut). He has pointed out that democratically-elected leaders turned despot/authoritarian/fascist will use tools like this to maintain power. Trump knows he cannot be reelected due to term limits, so how does he hold on to power? Like this. It is a slippery slope towards becoming a dictator. 
 
I can only hope that some countries/industries/companies see through this B.S. and fight back, but it is likely that many‚Äînow that their finances are being hurt‚Äîwill bend the knee. 

Going back to the common explanations for Trump's tariffs, here are my counterarguments:    

1. If this was intended to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A., that doesn't make a lot of sense. Companies aren't just going to upend decades of supply chains to invest billions into a country whose people don't want a lot of dirty, hard-work manufacturing jobs, especially when everything could (likely) revert back when Trump is out of office in 4 years.   
2. I won't pretend to be an economist, but a big reason for the trade imbalances is because Americans like buying stuff from XYZ countries. That isn't those countries' fault, necessarily. And moreover, the chart Trump showed at the White House Rose Garden this week did not accurately reflect the actual tariff rates that foreign countries place on the U.S.A‚Äîit included trade imbalances, which makes zero sense and is highly misleading, if not an outright lie.   
3. Trump may appear dumb, but he has scores of well-planned sycophants from groups like the Heritage Foundation (Project 2025 authors) that are advising him. It is highly unlikely that they planned so much of his presidency, but the tariffs themselves were an afterthought.   
  
Now granted, we have heard rumors that the tariffs were hastily put together, and that Trump's team may have used ChatGPT to write some of the policy out. At first, this appears to support explanation no. 3. However, I think the hasty nature of these tariff policies actually supports the idea that they are purely intended as political weapons: it doesn't matter what exactly the tariffs are, what matters is creating immediate leverage.   
  
Curious for the community's thoughts. 

Disclosure: I have divested heavily from the U.S. markets and gone into EU stocks, especially defense. I am also short TSLA, DJT, and Air Canada.

**EDIT:** As seeming proof of this theory, American journalist Kara Swisher [reported on BlueSky today](https://bsky.app/profile/karaswisher.bsky.social/post/3llynh6uoyk2z) that ""Several sources tell me a passel of high profile tech and also finance leaders is making a trip to Mar-a-Lago to read Trump the riot act ‚Äî um talk common sense ‚Äî to him on the tariffs. Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions in losses.""  
  
Translation, I think: executives are bending over backwards to try and get concessions from Trump. This shows he has leverage over them already.",2025-04-04 15:20:29,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jreh6b/cmv_trumps_tariffs_are_political_weapons/
1jqpre5,"Apple sheds $300 billion in tariff-fueled sell-off, on track for worst drop since March 2020","[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-sheds-300-billion-in-tariff-fueled-sell-off-on-track-for-worst-drop-since-march-2020-175727479.html)

Tech stocks plummeted on Thursday, with Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)) leading ""Magnificent Seven"" names lower following President Trump's[¬†reciprocal tariff announcement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-every-country-facing-reciprocal-tariffs-announced-by-trump-on-liberation-day-231329935.html)¬†the day prior.

Shares of Apple, on track for their worst day since March 2020, cratered over 8% in afternoon trade as the stock erased $300 billion from its market cap. The largest risk, according to analysts, centers on the iPhone maker's overseas production hubs, which are particularly vulnerable to the tariffed countries.

On Wednesday, Trump announced tariffs that will impact some 185 countries, including the United States's largest trading partners. Additional reciprocal tariffs, for instance, will include 34% tariffs on Chinese imports, a 20% tariff on European Union imports, a 46% tariff on imports from Vietnam, 32% on imports from Taiwan, and 26% on India ‚Äî all set to take effect on April 9.

Notably, the additional 34% tax on China will be added to the country's existing 20% tariff, meaning its total tariff rate will rise to 54%. China is Apple's most important¬†[production hub](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apple-supply-chain-trump-tariffs-china-diversify-iphone-2025-1?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=yahoo.com), with about 85% of its iPhones manufactured there.

""Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China, and the question will be around exceptions and exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations, factories, and plants in the US[¬†like Apple announced in February](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-will-spend-more-than-500-billion-usd-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years/),"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients following the announcement.

As trade tensions escalate, Apple has moved to increase its supply chain beyond just China, boosting manufacturing in places like India and Vietnam. But with the new tariff announcements set to impact those countries too, there's now limited room for reprieve.

""The worry will be around pricing and margin impacts along with what this means for the global supply chain looking forward,"" Ives said. For now, the analyst continues to believe major negotiations will happen over the coming months as companies attempt to navigate ""this new world of tariffs.""

Until then, he warned, ""tech stocks will clearly be under major pressure.""

Other Magnificent Seven players also faced significant selling action. In aggregate, that cohort of stocks is currently on track to eliminate over $800 billion from their collective market caps.

In afternoon trade, Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) and Nvidia ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA)) each fell 7%, followed by a 6% drop in both Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)) and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)). Meta ([META](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/META)) dipped 3%, while Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) was off just under 2%.

Outside of the Mag Seven, chip stocks faced similar declines, despite the exemption of semiconductors from Trump's additional tariffs. Nvidia competitor Broadcom ([AVGO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AVGO)), for example, erased well over $50 billion from its market cap following an 8% drop in shares.

""The implications \[of the announced tariffs\] are broad-reaching, and we see negative implications for the whole \[chip\] sector,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a note to clients. ""These are most notably going to negatively impact end-demand in key markets including smartphones/iPhones and PCs, as a significant amount of manufacturing is done within China.""

Stacy Rasgon, Bernstein's managing director and senior analyst, added in an interview with Yahoo Finance that the biggest headwind for semiconductors is not necessarily the direct impact of tariffs. Rather, it's the risk of demand destruction as these products become more expensive.

He added, ""The other risk for semis is that they are very cyclical, very global, and very correlated to the macro and to GDP.¬†[So if this tips us into recession,¬†](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-dangerously-vulnerable-to-recession-wall-street-reacts-to-tariff-fallout-155837444.html)that's probably not going to be great.""",2025-04-03 18:13:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jqpre5/apple_sheds_300_billion_in_tarifffueled_selloff/

# Trump speaks at the Rose Garden at 4PM EST today- be on the lookout for incremental headlines or anything that is passed on from his admin.

A sign of escalation and a warning, China is essentially responding in kind that it will give tariffs back (just like 2018). Reduced Chinese investment could result in less liquidity in the markets overall and larger volatility. If you want to see a reminder of how Chinese stocks performed when we got into a trade war, look at 2018-2019. We haven't a seen a meaningful move in these stocks yet, but if there are responses from China in kind to the tariff announcement today, things are going to get volatile,

Options include a tiered system (10%-20%) or a flat 20% global tariff. We're likely going to see a LOT of incremental headlines today on this until Trump speaks in the Rose Garden; I'll be watching what he says on the websites he posts on, and going for the speed trade on this. He is expected to talk at 4PM Eastern. Obviously, a lot of volatility and uncertainty due to no one knowing what exactly the tariff plans are going to be. The imposition of new tariffs could escalate trade tensions, leading to retaliatory measures from affected countries (which we don't know the extent of how many are affected) and impacting global economic growth.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Tesla reported preliminary March China deliveries of 78.8K vehicles vs 89.1K YoY. The company has delivered 336,681 cars in the first quarter, far fewer than the 390,000 expected. The decline in Tesla's China deliveries was a bit of a signal that the global sales would be bad, but frankly this wasn't as terrible as I expected. Currently short, will cover if we break $260 to the upside. Also interested in the $250 level. You guys know the risks by now (BYD and competitors, Musk, politics, etc).

No real move in these stocks yet but I expect any news headline that is negative for TikTok to be great for the companies I'm watching (social media rivals). A ban on TikTok could alter the membership for the social media sites mentioned (they have to go somewhere). Since this is a weekend headline, I'm thinking of buying more GOOG- if TikTok DOES get banned, then these companies will likely gain.

1jpo69r,"Tesla reports 336,000 vehicle deliveries in first quarter","Tesla¬†reported 336,000 vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2025, two days after the electric vehicle company‚Äôs stock wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.

Here are the key numbers:

* Total deliveries Q1 2025: 336,000
* Total production Q1 2025: 362,000

Investors were expecting Tesla to report deliveries of between 360,000 and 370,000 vehicles, according to StreetAccount. Tesla‚Äôs investor relations team sends a company-compiled consensus to select analysts, and said the average estimate was for around 377,590 deliveries. Prediction market company Kalshi¬†on Tuesday released a forecast for Tesla deliveries of 352,000.

In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla reported 386,810 deliveries, and production of 433,371 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of vehicle sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company‚Äôs shareholder communications.

Tesla doesn‚Äôt break out sales and production by model or region. However, the company said that it produced 345,454¬†of its most popular¬†Model 3 and Model Y cars¬†and delivered 323,800 of them in the three months ending March 31.

The company reported 12,881 deliveries of its other models, including its angular steel Cybertruck.

During the quarter, Tesla faced planned, partial shutdowns in some of its factories that allowed the company to upgrade manufacturing lines to start producing a redesigned version of its popular Model Y SUV.

CEO Elon Musk recently said during an¬†all-hands¬†session with Tesla employees that he expects the Model Y to be the ‚Äúbest-selling car on Earth again this year.‚Äù¬†

But Tesla has to contend with an onslaught of EV competition and reputational damage. In the first quarter, the company was hit with waves of¬†protests, boycotts and some criminal activity that targeted Tesla vehicles and facilities in response to Musk‚Äôs political rhetoric and his work as part of¬†President Donald Trump‚Äôs¬†second administration.

After spending $290 million to help return President Donald Trump to the White House, Musk is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he‚Äôs slashing costs, eliminating regulations and cutting tens of thousands of federal jobs.

Musk, the world‚Äôs wealthiest person, has also involved himself in European politics, promoting the anti-immigrant AfD party in Germany in February‚Äôs elections. Tesla‚Äôs business on the continent is struggling.

Across 15 European countries, Tesla‚Äôs market share declined to 17.9% in the first quarter from 9.3% in the same period a year earlier, according to data tracked by EU-EVs.com. In Germany, Tesla‚Äôs market share in battery electric vehicles plummeted to 4% from about 16% over that stretch.

Tesla shares¬†sank 36%¬†in the first quarter, their steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2022 and third-biggest decline in the company 15 years on the public market. The drop wiped out $460 billion in market cap.

1jpicww,"Tesla Hidey Hole (Richmond, VA)- Don't believe the numbers tomorrow but the ERDF is real.","Before I jump into the stock related stuff, as an old, I feel it is important to preface this with a little cautionary advice. Here is my three points of ""don't be stupid"":

1. I know Richmond has a storied history of burning shit going all the way back to the Civil War- but don't burn any Teslas. It's not worth it. And it's stupid. Furthermore, you are putting first responders at risk. You will also likely get caught. At least here in Virginia, there are [cameras everywhere](https://cardinalnews.org/2025/03/28/i-drove-300-miles-in-rural-virginia-then-asked-police-to-send-me-their-public-surveillance-footage-of-my-car-heres-what-i-learned/) and Tesla's themselves will record you. It's just not worth throwing your life away no matter how mad you might be. Before you get labeled a domestic terrorist and thrown in an El Salvadorian prison, read some Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and get some perspective. He wrote from a Russian gulag after sharing his negative opinion of Stalin. We are currently on Reddit and nobody is going to jail for it.
2. Don't harass individual Tesla owners. They didn't do anything to deserve it and most likely hate what is happening as well. I know some of them. It is unreasonable to ask them to dump their daily driver at a huge loss because Elon decided to make himself into a human lighting rod.
3. I deliberately waited for the ""Tesla Takedown"" to be over before making this post so nobody would get any bright ideas. What you think is making a difference is likely to have the opposite effect from what you are hoping for. The people trying to stick it to Trump just got him more [support from billionaires](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckvvlv3lewxo) after he was convicted and if you didn't notice, $TSLA started deep in the red yesterday after the Tesla Takedown over the weekend and rallied way back and finished considerably up today. None of that moved the needle in any direction but up. Furthermore, if you burn or vandalize a Tesla, the insurance company will pay for it and just jack up all of our rates in turn. If any destroyed cars are still owned by Tesla, they will just use accounting methods to write it off. And that is one less car they don't have to sell at a time when they aren't selling many, which is the ultimate point of this post and makes a nice segue.

If you are mad about what Elon Musk is doing, or just want to make money on your $TSLA puts (like me- position disclosed), what sends a stronger message? A few burnt up Teslas or entire parking lots full of them because nobody wants to buy them? In my opinion, as well as [others with puts](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/nick-denton-interview-thiel-musk) on Tesla and think Elon has lost it, it is the latter. Speaking of which... I found one such parking lot!

First, check out the few pictures I took of the local Tesla dealership here in Richmond (just outside the city). Their lot is clearly over capacity but nothing jaw dropping. There are a few dozen vehicles on the street and in a neighboring parking lot. After I shared these with a few friends, one of them told me that there were vehicle transporters unloading new Teslas near his work, which is a few miles away from the dealership and in an area of office buildings that have nothing to do with Tesla. I checked it out and there are a lot of them stuffed in the back of the lot. It's hard to see because I took the pictures at night and the cars are spread out but there are easily over 20 Cybertrucks and probably somewhere near 50 vehicles in total.

Hidey Hole-3: [https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh](https://imgur.com/Ay3oTZh)

Obviously, my local dealer isn't selling enough cars to keep up with their deliveries (no surprise to anyone). But the big question I have is: Are these vehicles considered ""delivered""? Tomorrow Tesla reports how many vehicles they have ""delivered"" (not the same as sold). And if you haven't been paying attention as of late, Tesla has had some questionable practices going on in [Canada with their sales](https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/elon-musk-tesla-under-investigation-canada-wrongfully-boosting-sales/) and some possible questions raised about their accounting methods with the [$1.4 billion discrepancy](https://mashable.com/article/tesla-missing-billion-dollars) in their books. Going back a little further, there was a whistleblower that reported [Tesla deliberately messes](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) with their delivery numbers to make it appear as if they are selling more new cars than they really are.

Point being, no matter what is reported tomorrow, I am not going to believe the numbers Tesla provides. If there are new Teslas being shoved into an obscure parking lot in my city, it has to be happening elsewhere. At some point, I suspect the vehicle overflow will get noticed in other places too. Has anyone else found a Tesla hidey hole?

Most importantly, even if the number suck tomorrow, I doubt it will make that much of a difference in the stock price because of the ERDF. What is the ERDF you ask? It is the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF). And this incredibly powerful field effect is really all that matters when it comes to anything ""Elon"". It's real. And people should acknowledge it as such or risk their own peril. Nothing logical or sane applies to Elon Musk and it never has.

Edit/Update: Despite missing on deliveries, $TSLA is not really down that much. Everything is being affected from the tariff news so any impact isn't really noticeable. And the sales miss is being explained away by the Model Y refresh, as widely expected and foretold by just about every media outlet covering Tesla. No surprises in the ERDF holding $TSLA strong despite the bad news.

But not Elon. In fact, just the opposite occurred. He became, and remains to be, the richest man on Earth. This displays the tremendous power of the ERDF- It is nothing like the world has ever seen. Even more powerful than [Jewish Space Lasers](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-qanon-wildfires-space-laser-rothschild-execute.html).

The ERDF is by far and away Elon's greatest invention and achievement. If there are two things Elon should get tremendous credit for, it is knowing when to invest in the right things and building hype around them. The guy is a six-dimensional hype machine from outer space with uncanny prescience. From PayPal to SpaceX, he saw where future opportunity was being underinvested in and took it over. When it comes to Tesla, he even knew when to make it ""not a car company"". Using the power of the ERDF, he made it an AI, self-driving vehicle, taxi, and humanoid robot company just in the nick of time before sales of their actual product fell off a cliff. This company is now known as ""Tessler"". Now, it doesn't matter if they sell any cars at all. Elon is using the ERDF to sell the future and even control the presidency. And it's working. It sounds crazy as hell but we are all watching this happen in real life.

Amazingly, the ERDF has allowed Elon to stall indefinitely on all promises of delivering the future and show absolutely no meaningful results for over a half-decade. Nor is Tesla a first mover in any of their new initiatives. Waymo (Google) has already launched self-driving taxis that are available using Uber and even in buzzing around in Austin Texas, where Tesla is headquartered. The idea of humanoid robots has been around forever. And one behemoth of a car company already developed one. But that happened over a quarter century ago. The car company was Honda and the robot was called ASIMO. And nobody cared. They discontinued it in 2018. Elon's ""Optimus"" has only been seen to do preprogrammed demos that look like Boston Dynamics routines from the early 2000's (nobody cares about them either). They have also been spotted shuffling around like Joe Biden. Neither the Robotaxi or Optimus robot are anywhere close to being released. And I have strong doubts as to what utility, if any, the Optimus robot will have for anybody. All of this seems to be a distraction created by the ERDF to draw attention away from the fact that Tesla still hasn't achieved ""full"" self-driving (and [ignored LIDAR sensors](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/03/17/lidar-vs-cameras-a-giant-fail-for-tesla/)). I am expecting Elon to come out with a ""Fred Flintstone"" sedan next, with no floor that you power with your feet, and telling everyone that it will be the future of travel. If Elon says it, then it ""Musk"" be true (the guy has a name that just keeps on giving).

With no first-mover advantage in the driverless taxi space, being behind tech giant Google there, and reviving an old failed sci-fi robot idea from their much larger and more established competitor in Honda, you would think Tesla would get graded down for unoriginality. But nope. The ERDF kicks in yet again and [most analysts are bullish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-dives-as-another-bullish-analyst-worries-about-deliveries-5e90f869) and astonishingly, Cathy Wood, seemingly most affected by the ERDF (and other things that make people stupid), thinks Tesla stock is going to reach an astounding [$2,600 in five short years](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-reaffirms-tesla-2-212612251.html)! That's about 10x more valuable than it is today, giving Tesla a market cap somewhere around $8.5 trillion dollars. That would make Tesla more valuable than all the other major auto manufacturers, Uber, Lyft, Google, Amazon, and Nvidia, combined in today's market (with a trillion to spare). Does that sound realistic? You can call me a skeptic of Cathy Wood...

Again, make no mistake, the ERDF is real. And if we are talking straight stock price, it matters. It might be the only thing that matters. Love him or hate him, it seems that Elon and his ERDF manufactured the most successful ad campaign in history right on the lawn of the White House. But it wasn't for the cars. It was for the stock. All the new people getting sucked into the ERDF because of Elon's new found bromance with Trump have no idea of what has been happening with Elon prior to his involvement in politics. And they don't care. They just know him as ""Tech Support"" guy and Trump's new ally. They love Trump and there is no shortage of them. They might be willing to wait another 5-years for Cathy's insane prediction to come true, not knowing everyone else had already been waiting for 5-years before them. Fresh meat so-to-speak. Tesla's 10-day average volume is over 138 million shares. And most of this is [retail traders going bonkers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true) for Tesla and Elon. It is likely that Elon has masterfully used his ERDF to transition retail stock holders from younger, tech savvy and/or environmentally conscious investors to straight up Fox News Dads in less than one quarter.

While it has already been noted on this sub that institutional investors are likely pumping $TSLA to orchestrate a soft landing for themselves (on the backs of retail investors), I don't think they can exit too quickly without causing a complete fiasco. They only have to report 30-days after each quarter ends and they trade in dark pools. So, we plebeians won't know what the big institutional holders are doing until after they have done it (unless they report sooner). And if any one big institutional investor dumps their position fast enough to spook the market, there will certainly be consequences. Both political and financial. The finances between Elon, his many ventures, and his personal loans must be a complete nightmare of both complexity and scale. While in theory Elon could be ""margin called"" for his loans that have Tesla stock put up as collateral for, I am not so sure it would happen even if the stock drops significantly. The banks just went through a crisis of confidence with the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse. If something triggered Elon's house of cards to collapse, it could have larger implications for his lenders and they might take a lot of heat for it. And the banks certainly don't want to invite in more oversight. They might just eat the loss and hold the shares in hopes they eventually regain their value. For that reason alone, I think the chances of Elon getting margin called are slim. But I would definitely be keeping an eye on the institutional holders once they report at the end of this month to see if there are any notable changes.

Edit/Update: A few hours after posting this, it was reported that [Swedish firm Folksam](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-its-tesla-shareholding-2025-04-02/) closed their entire position in Tesla. While not nearly as big as other institutional holders, it was still about $160M worth of stock. That's not chump change. (Mods: Sorry for originally using a Seeking Alpha article in the link- I didn't know they were blacklisted). 

To end this manifesto post, and give the shorts a little glimmer of hope, I offer one possibility that has not really been talked about all that much. Despite the massive power of the ERDF, some people do indeed escape it. And despite all the hype around AI, robots, and automation, Elon's companies are still run by the most unpredictable machines on the planet- humans. Tesla's long time CFO and potential successor for Elon, Zachary Kirkhorn, left suddenly in the [summer of 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cfo-zachary-kirkhorn-steps-down-replaced-by-vaibhav-taneja-2023-08-07/). Four more of Elon's top executives and direct reports left in [short order in 2024](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-loses-4-top-executives-ahead-of-robotaxi-event-2024-10). Baglino sold off his [$180 million in shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/former-tesla-svp-drew-baglino-is-selling-181point5-million-worth-of-stock.html) when he left. Not much of a vote of confidence there. And Tesla as a whole recently [fired a massive number of employees](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/tesla-started-laying-off-14000-employees-it-couldnt-have-gone-worse.html). From the reports, Elon seemingly did it in the same smug and indifferent manner in which he fired people at Twitter and is currently doing in the federal government.

Ultimately, if people become disenfranchised and are no longer willing to do Elon's bidding, his enterprises will fail. And there is only so much you can pay people to motivate them before you lose profitability. To make a Star Wars analogy, the only way I see to bring down the ERDF that protects and surrounds Elon's seemingly unstoppable Death Star, is if people on the inside of his operations lose faith in him and get tired of his bullshit. All the people around Elon: His loyal followers on X and even president Trump to some extent, don't do anything for him but build his ego and amplify the strength of the ERDF. But none of them know how to design and build cars or launch space shuttles. That's a very small group of very intelligent people that cannot be replaced as easily as retail investors. It's the smart people on the inside that make all of Elon's visions come into reality. In the end, I think the human element might be Elon's undoing.",2025-04-02 06:47:15,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jpicww/tesla_hidey_hole_richmond_va_dont_believe_the/

News: [US Stock Futures Tumble Ahead Of New Trump Tariffs: Markets Wrap ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-30/us-stock-futures-tumble-ahead-of-new-trump-tariffs-markets-wrap)

[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)**,** [**QQQ** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)**,** [**VXX** ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)**,** [**USO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=USO&p=d) , larger tech stocks - ""Liberation day"" (additional tariffs) is nearing, causing the market to selloff due to fears of escalating trade tensions and potential global growth impacts . We're pretty close to near lows from 3/13 (18 days ago, lol). 

Overall will be trying to buy a bounce for a day trade if we do end up breaking, but probably will be more focused on a VXX short rather than buying the market overall. I'm interested if we selloff or pop on the open, if we break new lows I may short/then flip long. This kind of headline-driven macro environment is a pain in the ass to keep track of, but creates a lot more opportunity for short-term trading. Risks that can change the tariff narrative or move the market include unexpected retaliation from trade partners, weakening consumer/investor confidence (like last week's numbers), and spillover into energy and commodity prices (Trump has signaled some action on oil, but we aren't sure what yet). 

**NVDA**[ **(Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)\- Another interesting thing that caught my eye this morning are reports from Chinese media that NVDA's new chip (GB300) are significantly delayed due to complexity and may be a quarter or two delayed (thus resulting in missed/delayed revenue). This could explain why NVDA is down significantly more (-3.5%) vs other semis. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) \- Analysts have trimmed Q1 delivery estimates for TSLA amid weakening demand trends and delays in its Model Q vehicle (the cheap, Robotoaxi car). There have also been articles of divestment from pension/investing funds that are invested in TSLA that I've read, but whether those are serious, I'd hold judgement on. 

Delivery numbers are expected Wednesday and typically report premarket, so good to be cognizant of that. I'm interested in seeing if we can hold below $250 today. The EV sector in general has entered a consolidation phase, with cost competition and flagging consumer incentives weighing on demand, and BYD is hot on TSLA's heels and likely going to overtake TSLA within the year. Below-consensus deliveries could spark a guidance reset for earnings, margin compression of their other cars due to the Model Q, and market share loss in China and Europe are key concerns. Also random people torching Tesla dealerships.

[**PLTR (Palantir Technologies Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PLTR&p=d) \- No material news catalyst, but PLTR has experienced five consecutive red sessions and is likely moving with the overall stock rout. Worth noting that PLTR cut close to 60% of its IT Team (said by CTO in recent interview), and DoD cut close to $600M in spending (which affects PLTR). Also worth noting that we are EXACTLY right back to where we started before we had significant retail interest in this stock ($80). The broader AI/data analytics sector has seen a pullback after a multi-month run and has been somewhat outpaced rational valuation so not too interested in this for the long term.

1jngg3e,Challenging the Noise: A Closer Look at Tesla's Q1 Projections,"As we have all seen, there are a ton of headlines about Tesla's (TSLA) declining sales numbers, and it's honestly a bit overwhelming. Here's a quick breakdown of what I gathered:

* Europe sales are reportedly down by 45%
* China sales have decreased by either 49% or 29%
* Australia sales are down by 65.5%

\^\^ keep in mind there are a ton of articles and headlines on this, I picked from a few \^\^

With all these headlines, it's tough to figure out what timeframes they're talking about. Is it one day, one week, three months? Who knows?

Amidst all this noise, I decided to dig deeper into what we should actually expect. While analysts' projections aren't great, they don't seem as grim as the headlines suggest.

**Global Tesla Sales (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 386,810 units
* **2025 Initial Projections**: 412,000 units (median of 398K-426K range, which would've been a 6.5% increase)
* **2025 Current Projections**: 377,000 units (a 2.5% decrease from Q1 2024)
* **Projection Change**: Initial to current projections dropped by 8.5%

**USA Sales Breakdown (Q1):**

* **2024 Actual**: 140,187 vehicles
* **2025 Current Projection**: 138,867 vehicles
* **Change**: Only a 0.9% decrease in the US market

These numbers don't look great, especially for a company like Tesla that's all about growth. But we're still talking about single-digit declines quarter-over-quarter, assuming the analysts are somewhat correct.

I wanted to understand what the Q1 report might reveal because, going by the headlines, it seemed like it would be terrible. But after digging in, it doesn't seem as bad as it feels. Is it just me?

What do you all think? Could the market react less harshly on Q1 review day than the news is making it out to be?",2025-03-30 16:37:34,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jngg3e/challenging_the_noise_a_closer_look_at_teslas_q1/

In Norway, Tesla is once again the best seller, but it's still down by around 20% from March 2024, and the Q1 total is down around 30%.

(MSTR usually trades at a 2x valuation to the amount of CC it holds.). Volatility in the CC market could create swings in reported earnings, but makes GME easier to track price-wise. The core retail business still saw a 28% Y/Y decline in sales which is somewhat of a red flag. Biased positive.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Second day of straight gains, with shares up 3.5% after a close to 50% selloff. I'm Interested in $290 level after failing to break above it in the premarket. EV sentiment remains mixed for TSLA going forward- despite weakness in European sales, investor sentiment appears to be shifting positive. Sales in Europe fell 40% Y/Y, and Canada‚Äôs EV rebate freeze adds regulatory actions into the mix. BYD is also close to overtaking TSLA, so I still don't consider this investible for the long-term (but it is tradable).

The stock reacted fairly positively on this news, mainly because DLTR has been struggling since COVID. This move is an effort to clean up the balance sheet and refocus on the core business. The market probably views this favorably in the face of tariffs - less potential exposure to Family Dollar inevitably underperforming.

China‚Äôs energy mandates are squeezing data center hardware providers, forcing chipmakers to adapt or lose access to the market. Having the H20 not be usable is a huge blow to NVDA's revenue, as it makes up close to 10% of their revenue in 2024.

1jjvzui,Stocks Close Higher for 3rd Straight Day; Tesla Surges in Late Trading to Extend Rally,"
Major indexes closed slightly higher Tuesday as the stock market continued its recovery from an extended selloff.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose fractionally. Stocks had kicked off the week with big gains following news that President Trump could scale back some of the tariffs that are due to be imposed next week on U.S. trading partners. With the recent gains, the Dow has inched back into positive territory for 2025, as stocks have rebounded from a month-long selloff spurred by concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.

Investors brushed off consumer confidence data released this morning that came in weaker than expected, with the index hitting its lowest level in more than four years. Investors are closing watching all data points amid worries that tariffs could reignite inflation and cause economic growth to stall. The big economic report of the week comes Friday with the scheduled release of the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had fallen during the recent stock market rout amid the growing concerns about the economy, was at 4.32% in late trading, down from 4.33% at yesterday's close and from an earlier high Tuesday of 4.37%. The yield, which affects costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, hit its highest level in more than a month this morning.

Mega-cap technology stocks, which helped lead Monday's rally, were mostly higher again today. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied late in the day to finish 3.5% higher, gaining ground for the 5th consecutive session, despite news Tuesday that the EV maker's sales in Europe continued to slide. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta Platforms (META) each rose more than 1%, while Microsoft (MSFT) inched ahead. Chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) closed slightly lower

1jiqjct,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE),¬†[VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK),¬†[BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV),¬†[9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK),¬†[GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.

News: [US Treasuries Fall on Signs That Trump Will Dilute April Tariffs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/us-treasuries-fall-on-signs-that-trump-will-dilute-april-tariffs)

This has resulted in a market bounce and overall means that markets will likely NOT be as impacted by tariffs as they were expecting. 

The tariff game Trump is playing reminds me of that scene from the office: ""You have no idea the physical toll three vasectomies have on a person! Snip Snap! Snip Snap! Snip Snap!"" -Michael Scott. 

Anyway back to the watchlist. 

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\- Seen a significant bounce in TSLA due to the news of the lessened (supposedly) future tariffs‚Äîinterested in seeing if we can break above $260 at open; otherwise, not interested and likely still will be negatively biased. This might actually be reacting a little positively due to BYD's blowout earnings. BYD reported $107B annual revenue for the year and are close to TSLA's profit! Mainly concerned in the long run about margin compression due to pricing cuts, increased competition in the EV space, macro headwinds, and of course, Elon making fork sculptures in the White House but no one appreciating them. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\- MicroStrategy buys 6,911 more of the underlying, now holds over 506k, currently at 2x premium. Nothing too interesting to note beyond the typical upwards move from whenever MSTR announces a buy of the underlying. We've bounced slightly off the lows, but worth noting that the underlying is also rose from news that Trump might use his gold holdings to buy more. I always keep in mind MSTR's heavy dependence on underlying performance, regulatory scrutiny, and volatility, of course. Related tickers to watch on this are RIOT and COIN/HOOD.

[**LUNR (Intuitive Machines)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d)\- Reported strong Q4 and FY24 results. Q4 revenue of $54.7M (+80% YoY) and FY24 revenue of $228.0M (nearly 3x YoY).

Backlog reached $328.3M (+22% YoY), with **projected positive run-rate Adj. EBITDA by year-end**. Overall backlog seemed to be the second most important factor, signifies that there is future revenue and they are far more financially stable than anticipated and even profitable by year end! I have a very small position long. Going to bail if we break below $7 but overall I think there are many tailwinds that can help LUNR. **L**UNR's main risks are execution risk tied to lunar missions (beginning of this month saw the stock fall close to 50% in a single day), contract delays, reliance on government funding, and high R&D intensity with limited margin buffer/no defined return. Also watching RKLB on this. 

[**AZEK (The AZEK Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AZEK&p=d)\- James Hardie to acquire AZEK in a cash/stock deal valued at $8.75B (including debt). AZEK holders to receive $26.45 cash + 1.034 JHX shares, totaling \~$53/share (as of premarket prices)**.** These hybrid stock/cash acquisitions can fluctuate in price because of how the acquirer pays with their own stock. Typical M&A risks apply such as integration risk, housing market softness, FX exposure (James Hardie also trades in Australia IIRC), regulatory risk, etc.

1ji0n3r,"Tariffs, DOGE and Columbia ‚Äî The market will crash because Trumpism is not capitalism","There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn‚Äôt understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It‚Äôs half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can‚Äôt, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations.¬†

The cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don‚Äôt yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I‚Äôm sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples.¬†

I have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration.¬†

TSLA was one of last year‚Äôs magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk‚Äôs popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump‚Äôs continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market.¬†

Finally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he‚Äôs making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck.¬†

So nothing would be at a loss. I just feel we are facing a man made intentional potential crash of US stocks. Could be short term or long term. One issue, I‚Äôm also near retirement age so I don‚Äôt have 20 years to wait for a correction. 
Let me further say all my eggs are not in one basket. I‚Äôm fully diversified with only 1/3 of my liquid assets in stock. Because of my age 2/3 is in very safe such as CD‚Äôs near 5%. Also 2 houses paid off, nice car paid off, zero debt on credit cards paid off monthly.

1jg4qgf,Short sellers have made $15 billion betting against Tesla and Nvidia in 2025,"Short sellers have been cleaning up to start 2025 amid a massive sell-off in some of the market's most popular names over the past two years.

Short sellers have made a combined $15 billion betting against Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) stock thus far this year, according to data from S3 Partners. Tesla shorts alone have raked in nearly $11 billion, while bets against Nvidia have brought in more than $4 billion.

Tesla's 40% year-to-date drop has led the declines of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks. Investors have grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's focus on government efficiency efforts and how his role with President Trump's administration could be a turnoff to the electric vehicle maker's customer base.

But it hasn't just been Tesla lagging. As an index, the Magnificent Seven ‚Äî which also includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) ‚Äî is underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter by the most since 2022.

Short sellers have profited off of all of the names in the cohort this year. They've brought in nearly $5 billion betting against Apple stock, which is down nearly 14% in 2025.

The crash in the most popular trade of the past two years comes as investors have been re-rating their growth expectations. Fears of slowing economic growth and the impact of Trump's tariff policies have weighed on markets. Meanwhile, Big Tech has faced growing investor criticism about its ballooning AI spend and whether or not it will eventually boost future profits as much as Wall Street hopes. The year also included a massive drawdown in some large tech names, including Nvidia, following the release of a cheaper AI model from Chinese company DeepSeek.

Now, with most of the names sitting around 20% off their recent 52-week highs, the looming question for markets is whether or not investor appetite for the stocks that led the market higher for the past two years will return.

""Maybe these tech stocks got ahead of their skis a little bit,"" BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski told Yahoo Finance last week. ""But at the end of the day, these are monster companies that define the growth trajectory for the United States stock market. They are not going away.""

1jg4o6x,Exclusive-Tesla trade-ins on pace for record high amid Musk backlash,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Motorists have traded in a record number of Tesla (TSLA) electric vehicles this month, Edmunds data showed, amid a wave of protests against CEO Elon Musk's work as an adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Tesla cars from model year 2017 or newer accounted for 1.4% of all the vehicles traded in until March 15, up from 0.4% in March last year, according to data provided to Reuters by Edmunds. Analysts at the national car shopping website said that share could grow through the second half of the month.

In February, the Trump administration's first full month, Teslas made up 1.2% of vehicles traded in.

March's trade-ins so far would be the highest monthly share Edmunds has on record of Tesla trade-ins toward new or used purchases at dealerships, if the trend continues. This excludes trade-ins toward new purchases of Teslas and EVs from other direct-to-consumer brands.

Musk is leading the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency and activists across the U.S. have staged so-called Tesla Takedown demonstrations over his role in cuts to the federal workforce and cancellation of contracts that fund global humanitarian programs.

Social media has been rife with posts from Tesla owners in the U.S. and some European countries showing them giving up their vehicles in displays of anger toward Musk.

The March data on Tesla trade-ins has not been previously reported.

""Brand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk's increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand,"" said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights.

Spokespersons for Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has said it expects the vehicle business to return to growth this year, after a small drop in 2024.

Prices of used Teslas have dropped in line with other EVs from Ford, Kia and Hyundai, according to Edmunds.

Used Tesla prices will likely decline further as Tesla trade-ins that are undergoing reconditioning reach the market, Edmunds analysts said.

Anger against the brand has resulted in Tesla vehicles being set on fire and damage to the company's showrooms and charging stations.

Trump has said he would label such attacks as domestic terrorism.

Tesla stock, which skyrocketed since Trump's election in November on hopes it would be easier for the company to roll out robotaxis under the new administration, has nearly halved from its January peak.

Fred McKinney, a corporate consultant, traded in his 2018 Tesla Model 3 last month to show his disapproval of Musk.

""I thought about putting a bumper sticker on my car saying, 'I hate Musk.' But selling the car feels so much better,"" he said on a LinkedIn post. ""If you are considering a new EV, under no circumstances consider buying a Tesla.""

Data from Edmunds also showed shoppers' consideration of new Teslas dropped to 1.8% last month - the lowest level since October 2022 - after peaking at 3.3% in November.

Tesla's sales likely fell 10% in February, hurt by declines in its Cybertruck pickup, Model 3 sedan, and Model Y SUV, separate estimates from market research firm Cox Automotive showed on Thursday.

""These shifts in Tesla consumer sentiment could create an opportunity for legacy automakers and EV startups to gain ground,"" Caldwell said.

""As Tesla brand loyalty and interest waver, those offering competitive pricing, new technology, or simply less controversy could capture defecting Tesla owners and first-time EV buyers.""

Many Tesla shorts and detractors have questioned Tesla‚Äôs accounting for years, but they have never gained much traction ‚Äì until now.
Today, the Financial Times has released a new report pointing to a $1.4 billion gap in assets:

1jfidz3,A Deeper Dive on Trump's Tariffs and Market Positioning,"Trump‚Äôs latest trade policies are hammering the markets‚ÄîS&P 500 down \~9%, Nasdaq off \~12%‚Äîand it looks like he‚Äôs doubling down. Tariffs on China, Canada, Mexico, and the EU are back on the table, with zero indication that he‚Äôs backing down. While some sectors (steel, domestic manufacturing) stand to benefit, others (tech, autos, multinational retailers) are getting crushed. The question is: at what point does the market pain force Trump to change course?

The **2025 Trade Policy Agenda** lays out his vision:

‚úÖ **Tariffs as leverage** ‚Äì forcing trade partners into more ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù deals

‚úÖ **USMCA review (2026)** ‚Äì questioning whether Canada & Mexico are benefiting unfairly

‚úÖ **Hardline stance on China** ‚Äì blaming it for the U.S. trade deficit and pushing for stricter enforcement of trade agreements

His strategy? **Drive U.S. production up, cut reliance on imports, and force foreign partners to play by his rules.** But markets are worried about **inflation, supply chain disruption, and retaliatory tariffs**‚Äîall of which are starting to bite.

Not every company is hurting‚Äîsome stand to **benefit significantly** from Trump‚Äôs protectionist approach. Trump‚Äôs tariffs **shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition**, making U.S. steel, aluminum, and energy companies prime beneficiaries. E.g 

* **U.S. Steel** X 25% steel tariffs will boost profits
* **Cleveland-Cliffs** CLF Increased demand for domestic steel
* **Nucor** NUE Largest U.S. steel producer, stronger pricing power
* **Anheuser-Busch** BUD Domestic production = insulated from trade costs
* **Prologis** PLD Companies stockpiling goods = warehouse demand surge
* **Lockheed Martin** LMT Defense spending likely to rise under Trump
* **Marathon Petroleum** MPC Energy independence push favors domestic refiners

Companies with **complex supply chains** and reliance on **overseas production** are getting squeezed by **higher input costs and potential retaliatory tariffs**.E.g

* **Apple** AAPL Major China exposure, supply chain at risk
* **Tesla** TSLA Higher costs across supply chain, could hurt margins
* **General Motors** GM Tariffs on parts increase manufacturing costs
* **Ford** F Supply chain disruptions could impact production
* **Nike** NKE Manufacturing in China = higher import costs
* **Amazon** AMZN Increased cost of goods from global suppliers
* **Boeing** BA Risk of Chinese retaliation cutting aircraft orders 

Are you positioning for a **domestic manufacturing boom**, or do you think **this trade war will spiral into a full-blown recession**? Should we be **buying the dip** in industrials or **shorting overexposed multinationals**?

  
Trump‚Äôs strategy is clear: use **tariffs as a multipurpose weapon**, not just for trade but also for **immigration and national security**. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted that **Canada & Mexico could avoid tariffs if they ‚Äúimprove border security‚Äù and crack down on fentanyl trafficking**. This suggests Trump is **negotiating in multiple arenas at once**, using economic pressure to force compliance on broader policy goals.

The problem? **Markets hate uncertainty**, and businesses can‚Äôt plan if policy keeps shifting based on unrelated factors. While some U.S. industries benefit, long-term uncertainty could hurt investment, expansion, and consumer confidence.",2025-03-20 06:08:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jfidz3/a_deeper_dive_on_trumps_tariffs_and_market/

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**News:** [**Turkish Police Detains Erdogan Rival Ekrem Imamoglu**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-19/turkish-police-detains-erdogan-rival-ekrem-imamoglu)

[**INTC (Intel)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)\- TSMC board member Paul Liu has dismissed rumors regarding TSMC's potential acquisition of INTC's foundries, stating that such discussions have never occurred within the company. Overall caused a small selloff in INTC but nothing major- recently the more major catalyst was the new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. The market mainly considered this a rumor so interesting to see it still cause a small move. Overall not too interested unless we sell off more. TSM's clear denial of interest in acquiring INTC's foundries shows that they're not really interested in bringing more production to the US or really partnering with a US solution. Overall more of a interesting geopolitical note.

TSMC news came from Digitimes (a daily industry newspaper from Taiwan on the semicondcutor industry)

[**TUR (Turkey ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TUR&p=d)\- The arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, a prominent rival to President Erdoƒüan has led to a significant selloff in the Turkish lira and Turkish assets. We've fallen close to 10% overnight in TUR, the Turkey ETF. Overall this likely won't see recovery for a few months. Last coup I remember was back in 2016 and it took a few months for TUR to recover (and it didn't do so linearly) so ultimately not interested in this. Continued political unrest and potential sanctions could further devalue Turkish assets, but I doubt there will be any outside intervention. EEM (the emerging markets ETF) seems to be unaffected overall.

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) **-** California's Public Utilities Commission has granted TSLA a transportation charter-party carrier permit, allowing the company to transport employees in company-owned vehicles, marking a step towards potential public ride-hailing services. The first piece of good news in a while for this stock. Overall I don't think it's good enough to make it have a significant recovery but interested to see if we make any gains today. Watching $235 level. Another step towards self-driving! Risks to watch on this piece of news and blowback are regulatory hurdles, public safety concerns, the overall political risks with TSLA, other self-driving competitors.

1jetgkm,Tesla gets first in a series of permits it needs to run robotaxis in California,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - Tesla¬†[(TSLA.O),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O)¬†on Tuesday received the first in a series of approvals from California required for the electric car maker to eventually launch a promised robotaxi service in the state, according to a state regulator.The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said it approved Tesla's application for a¬†[transportation charter-party carrier permit](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-seeking-approval-offer-ride-hailing-services-california-bloomberg-news-2025-02-27/)¬†(TCP), a license typically associated with chauffeur-operated services, allowing the company to own and control a fleet of vehicles and transport employees on pre-arranged trips.

The permit is a prerequisite for applying to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service in California, but a CPUC spokesperson said the current permit ""does not authorize them to provide rides"" in autonomous vehicles, and does not allow Tesla to operate a ride-hailing service to the public.With sales growth slowing, Tesla CEO¬†[Elon Musk](https://www.reuters.com/business/elon-musk/)¬†pivoted his focus last year to rolling out robotaxis and has promised driverless ride-hailing services to the public in California and Texas this year. In October, Tesla revealed the¬†[Cybercab](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-unveil-robotaxis-amid-fanfare-skepticism-2024-10-10/), a robotaxi concept that had no steering wheel or control pedals.Tesla had applied for the TCP permit in November 2024, the regulator said in an email, adding that the company had not applied for the other permits yet.Tesla would also need permits from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and CPUC in order to operate a fully autonomous robotaxi service that charges customers.Tesla currently only has a DMV permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver.A DMV spokesperson said on Tuesday that Tesla has not applied for any additional permits from the agency, which would be required to move forward with a CPUC application for driverless taxis.Tesla did not respond to requests for comments on the permit and details on the other applications.

1jeqaup,Trump‚Äôs Trade War 2.0: The Stocks I‚Äôm Watching,"With Trump back in office and tariffs returning in full force, I‚Äôve been analyzing what this means for U.S. equities. His latest moves‚Äî25% steel and aluminum tariffs, expanded levies on Chinese imports, and a tariff-heavy negotiation strategy‚Äîecho his first term but with even **stronger measures**.



While 2018-2020 gave us some clues, the market setup in 2025 is **different**:

‚Ä¢ **Higher inflation & rates:** Tariffs add inflationary pressure, making the Fed‚Äôs job harder.

‚Ä¢ **China‚Äôs response will change:** Unlike in 2018, China now **dominates EV battery production** and **controls rare earth supply chains**‚Äîthis could hurt U.S. tech more than before.

‚Ä¢ **Supply chain resilience is mixed:** Companies have talked about reshoring for years, but it‚Äôs still expensive and slow.

Given these factors, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôm positioning:

**Likely Winners:**

1. **Steel & Aluminum (NUE, STLD, CLF)** ‚Äì Tariffs give them pricing power, though cost inflation is a risk.

2. **Defense & Cybersecurity (LMT, PLTR, CRWD)** ‚Äì ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù likely means **higher defense budgets**.

3. **Regional Banks (JPM, BAC, GS)** ‚Äì If deregulation follows, these should gain.

4. **Domestic Infrastructure (CAT, DE, OSK)** ‚Äì If tariffs hurt foreign suppliers, U.S. construction demand rises.



**Likely Losers:**

1. **Tech Giants (AAPL, NVDA, QCOM, INTC)** ‚Äì Heavy China exposure = supply chain and revenue risks.

2. **Consumer Goods (NKE, WMT, DG)** ‚Äì Imports get pricier, and passing costs to lower-income customers is tough.

3. **Auto & Industrial (TSLA, GM, F, MMM)** ‚Äì Higher input costs + China retaliation = pain.

4. **Agri Exporters (ADM, TSN, BG)** ‚Äì If China targets U.S. farm products again, these get hit.



**What I‚Äôm watching:**

üìå Will China retaliate with rare earth metal export bans? (Impacts TSLA, NVDA, QCOM)

üìå Do inflation expectations rise, pushing Fed policy hawkish? (Bad for rate-sensitive stocks)

üìå Does Trump backtrack on any tariffs? (A la 2019)

üìå Will domestic manufacturing gains **outweigh** supply chain disruptions?

I‚Äôd love to hear counterpoints. Which stocks do you think will **outperform or underperform** in Trump‚Äôs Trade War 2.0?",2025-03-19 05:55:08,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jeqaup/trumps_trade_war_20_the_stocks_im_watching/

BYD has unveiled its Super e-Platform, capable of charging an electric vehicle to achieve 400 kilometers (approximately 249 miles) of range in just five minutes. This technology will debut in the upcoming Han L sedan and Tang L SUV models set to launch in April. Negative bias. We're down close to 50% since post-election highs and we've had even more bad news yesterday due to the video showing the limitation of non-LIDAR cars. Unless we see some Hail Mary throw from Elon and Trump or a massive dump in the near future, I'm not interested in going long this stock. Maybe a day trade for any spike down, but not a multi-day swing long.

[**SRPT (Sarepta Therapeutics)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SRPT&p=d) **-** Sarepta Therapeutics reported the death of a young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy following treatment with its gene therapy, ELEVIDYS. The patient experienced acute liver failure, a known potential side effect of the therapy. Worth noting that SRPT made roughly $180M in quarterly revenue from this drug, clearly a significant amount for a company that generates $638M net product revenue a quarter. (\~30%!) Interested in going long if we see a larger selloff. 

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d) \- Announced a proposed offering of 5 million shares of its Series A Preferred Stock.  This is an attempt to raise capital without diluting common stock (what we all typically trade). Still a bearish signal, negative bias. The underlying is still hovering at \~$82K, so MSTR is probably just trying to cash as much as they can out in case the underlying stays relatively price stable for the foreseeable future.

[**XPEV (XPeng)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XPEV&p=d) \- XPEV reported earnings with revenue of $2.01B, a 20% increase year-over-year, and a 52.1% increase in vehicle deliveries compared to the previous year. Overall, another sign the EV market in China will dominate. Despite being unprofitable, they are reaching more cars sold and are expanding for growth (something that no EV company in the US has managed to do **at scale** except for TSLA). The EV market in China is obviously more competitive than in the US so they're not out of the woods yet for the long term.

1jc36c5,Tesla stock declines could cost Elon Musk something important,"Snippet from this article:‚ÄùAfter a slight rebound earlier this week, Tesla's TSLA stock is back to falling, keeping with its recent performance. Even U.S. President Donald Trump's purchase of one hasn‚Äôt done much to spark real momentum for the electric vehicle (EV) leader.
After enjoying significant growth throughout the final months of 2024 and through early 2025, TSLA¬†has lost its previous momentum and isn‚Äôt showing signs of a rebound. As reports of declining sales and shifting consumer sentiment continue to trend, it's hard to ignore the company‚Äôs questionable outlook.

Link: https://www.thestreet.com/technology/tesla-stock-declines-could-cost-elon-musk-something-important

Many of these problems can be traced to CEO Elon Musk, who is preoccupied with his new responsibilities at the Department of Government Efficiency. His absence at Tesla‚Äôs manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.
Musk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining.¬†

Musk‚Äôs intertwined business empire could be in trouble 
Tesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.
Now that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven‚Äôt been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.

Tesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk‚Äôs leadership

This week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock‚Äôs poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.

Saw these move mainly due to recession fears and the entire market panicking, MASSIVE move yesterday.

Yesterday, mainly traded TSLA on the overnight exchanges. It had the largest move and got down to around $212. Overall a lot of negative sentiment ranging from boycotts and Elon controversies. Not too interested in trading TSLA today again.  I'm interested in NVDA if we break below 100 but again I think that we'll mainly see a small bounce today rather than breaking new lows. As for RDDT, we're 50% down from highs! Interesting swing candidate but will see how today goes. To me these are the standout stocks yesterday to trade due to recession fears. I don't really see a way out for TSLA regarding the boycotts.

That drop was close to 25%, mainly because Dustin owns close to 54% of the company, which signals a LOT of uncertainty and lack of faith in the company. Overall outlook is decently disappointing, and I'm mainly interested in it if we break $11.50 and very interested in buying $10.

AAL projected a higher-than-expected Q1 loss and revised its revenue outlook downward, attributing the weaker forecast to softness in the domestic leisure segment. This is probably amplified by fears of flying, mainly due to people being terrified of all the plane accidents that have happened in 2025. Recession fears also lead to people cutting their vacations/discretionary spending and saving money, so things may get worse.

1j7zm8c,Why the 2025 Bear Market is the real deal & only just getting started,"When it comes to recent major market corrections, the largest drops have coincided with the loosening of interest rates. There have been market corrections outside of these periods, however, those events are significantly lesser in scope compared to the current analog situations of 2000, 2008, and 2020. 

The Fed Funds rate was held at 6.5% from June 2000 to December 2000. It was 5.25 from July of 2006 to July of 2007. It was 2.4 between January of 2019 and July of 2019. 

As the Fed began cutting rates, in each situation, the market began to decline. However, it was during these declines that illiquidity events took place, causing major panic, and subsequent cratering of markets. 

The 1-point decline in interest rates from peak coincides with February 2001, December 2007, and November of 2019. Each respective recession officially began in March of 2001, December of 2007, and February 2020. 

We hit 1-point below peak in January. There is a strong possibility we are ALREADY in recession, however, genius economists will only tell us this in a year or two. 

In any case, each of these recessions coincided with feat contagion and general panic. Each of these events also bottomed after major catastrophes - in 2000 it was 9/11 and Enron, in 2008 it was Lehman + subprime crisis, in 2019 it was.... that horrible thing that we no longer talk about. 

We are already in the fear stage of the market. 2000's panic was a general meltdown PRIOR to the crises that later unfolded. However, it was those crises that marked its bottom. 2008 and 2020's craterings occurred simultaneous to their crises although stocks did drift down prior to 2008 as well. 

This begs the question: what is the crisis that may or may not occur with the cyclical correction that happens as the Fed cuts rates EVERY cycle? Will it be a true black swan no-one saw coming (9/11) or will it be something like Enron, Lehman, or COVID, where some DID see what was coming ahead of the general panic?

Could TSLA be the Enron of the 2025 bust? It is seeming more and more plausible with each passing day. In any case, the bottom of the market in each of the aforementioned cases occurred simultaneous to the Fed funds rate hitting 0 (or almost 0 in 2003). I expect shelter contribution to CPI to vanish in the next few reports + unemployment to rise significantly, this could give the Fed leeway to put rates back to 0 as soon as Q3-Q4 2025. In both 2009 and 2020 the Fed rate hit 0 when annualized CPI did the same (in March), and March of both years also coincided with their respective market bottoms. 

TLDR; we are far from the bottom, which should occur when Fed Funds hit 0, buy when that happens but before that point, gird your loins.",2025-03-10 14:16:06,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7zm8c/why_the_2025_bear_market_is_the_real_deal_only/
1j7suox,People who stay away from TSLA: at what price would you consider opening a position in?,"Revenue has plateaued, it exploded in to $400 simply due to US elections, and has now corrected itself back in to where it was pre-election. Constant bad news about cars sales plummeting in European countries. Valuation-wise way way way overvalued, many of the bull thesis around hype that TSLA is more than just a car company through batteries and eventual AI. Musk, as he has been doing for years, makes the stock volatile and swinging with his antics.

Fundamentally TSLA would have to go to something like $100 if you view it purely from a valuation point. But obviously pure valuation doesn't factor in to this stock; there will always be speculation, hype, and hope for new technology disruptions baked in.

At what price then would you consider it having gone too low enough for you to open a position and let market sentiments carry it back up?",2025-03-10 07:01:47,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j7suox/people_who_stay_away_from_tsla_at_what_price/
1j7l0bv,TSLA being investigated by Transport Canada for cooking their books in Canada to snag EV rebates without selling cars.,"The article notes that **four Tesla dealerships claimed to have sold 8,653¬†Teslas in 3 days.** Assuming each dealership opens from 9AM-5PM, that's **90 cars sold per hour per dealership**. Worth noting that Canada's EV rebate program was set to shut down, interesting how Tesla found 8,600 sales in 3 days before it did...

Ironic that Musk, who has recently repeatedly said that people who rely on government payments are leeches and that Canada is not a real country, is now accused of trying to leech off of Canadian taxpayer-funded EV rebates himself to the tune of $43M.

I guess that's one way to maintain revenue while sales drop 90%!

Note: investigation is ongoing and there has been no confirmation of official wrongdoing yet.

Edit: Since this post got more attention then I expected. Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today. However I do not think this is causing the drop, and rather it‚Äôs an overall market pull back from trade wars and from Europe sales declines. The article was published Friday morning and Tesla was up 3% by end of Friday.

1j43x5l,These are the stocks on my watchlist (03/5) - Trump's Speech Dissect,"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

Today is mostly related to Trump's speech yesterday. Secretary Lutnick announced yesterday ""Tariffs compromise announcement will likely come tomorrow"", so will be on the lookout for that.

News: [Trump Hails Tariffs as US Economy Barrels Into Trade Wars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-to-tout-tariffs-unveil-energy-mineral-projects-in-speech)

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)**,** [**AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)**,** [**SMH (Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)**,** [**SOXL (3x Semiconductor ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has called for an end to the CHIPS Act Subsidy Program (instead preferring tariffs).

**Technicals:** Short biased. Obviously this takes away a lot of investment in semis companies. Extremely negative catalyst but unlikely it will get repealed due to how much bipartisan support it had.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The CHIPS and Science Act gave $280B in new funding to boost domestic research/manufacturing of semis in the US, and also aimed to strengthen supply chain resilience against China and widely considered to be a success because it spurred the development/dominance in the semis sector in America.

**Risks:** If this gets repealed, we're likely going to see a pretty large pullback in the semis. Obviously this is dependent on what the tariffs Trump touts will do as well. [I wrote a little more about my take on a different post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j437g9/trump_calls_for_end_to_52_billion_chips_act/) but overall more of the same (I think it's a terrible idea).

**Ticker:** [**GM (General Motors)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GM&p=d)**,** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)**,** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The Trump administration is considering granting relief from the recently imposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports for products that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

**Technicals:** We've seen all three stocks (GM especially) make gains due to this announcement, will watch at open for volume.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The automotive industry in US/Canada/Mexico involves the most economic/manufacturing cooperation in the USMCA, they're the most obvious beneficiaries of this potential catalyst.

**Risks:** If they don't actually give relief, then will likely pullback- cars are one of the most affected products of tariffs and pretty much every car company has spoken about tariffs on their earnings calls.

**Ticker:** [**IBIT (IBIT)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=IBIT&p=d)**,** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**,** [**HOOD (Robinhood Markets)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that Trump plans to grant the main biggest CC a ""unique status"" within the Bitcoin reserve strategy, which will be unveiled at the White House Crypto Summit on Friday.

**Technicals:** We've seen the underlying spike close to 8-9% since yesterday, watching $90K level. Interested to see how we go prior to the actual summit.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Obviously an extremely bullish catalyst, we've bounced strongly off the $80K level recently. I usually trade through the ETFs as needed, and HOOD/Coinbase serve as proxies in case the ETFs aren't liquid or have already moved.

**Risks:** Worth waiting for the catalyst and watching the CC Summit on Friday. I personally see this more of a ""buy on hype"" kind of catalyst, unless there's an announcement of something extremely bullish I'm not sure how much more this will move the needle.

**Ticker:** [**HII (Huntington Ingalls Industries)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HII&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Trump has announced initiatives aimed at strengthening the U.S. shipbuilding industry to counter China's dominance, spoke about the creation of a White House Office of Shipbuilding and the introduction of special tax incentives.

**Technicals:** None that I'm particularly interested in, this is a longer-term play.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China produces over half of the world's merchant vessels, this is more of a play to reduce reliance on foreign-shipping.

**Risks:** There's a chance that this will never happen, Trump tried to create a ""Cybersecurity Department"" in his first term but that was never formally created and we kept those duties spread out between the FBI/DHS/NSA. But we also have the Space Force so... stay tuned.

After an analyst posted a prediction that Tesla would increase its profits by 256%, Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded

>It will require outstanding execution, but I think more like 1000% gain for Tesla in 5 years is possible.

The comment was quickly propagated by Elon fans and the community of ‚ÄúTesla all-ins‚Äù as being a sign that Musk, who is quite busy with X and DOGE lately, still believes in Tesla.

Tariffs are here.

News: [Trump Tariffs China, Canada, Mexico](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2025-03-04/trump-tariffs-china-canada-mexico)

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reports preliminary February China deliveries of 30,688 cars, down close to 50% from last year.

**Technicals:** Overall a brutal delivery report. TSLA has been on a slide since post-election highs and frankly shows no real sign of recovery. Looking for a small bounce in this stock but I don't think there is much potential for long-term recovery.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** TSLA's EV sales have been declining in China mainly due to BYD, which are considered to make better cars for far cheaper outside the US. The US has a 100% EV tariff for non-US made EV vehicles.

**Risks:** BYD has been eating TSLA's lunch outside of the US. I truly don't see TSLA retaining dominance as the EV of choice outside the US. 

**Ticker:** [**OKTA (Okta)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OKTA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Okta beat earnings expectations with EPS of $.78 vs $.74,gave guidance that supports EPS of $3.20 vs $2.93. (Also note that CRWD reports today but are not direct competitors)

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Cybersecurity (more specifically IAM) grows yearly mainly due to RPO and cRPO (remaining performance obligations). This is subscription backlog expected to be recognized over the next 12 months.

**Risks:** Market saturation/pricing concerns from competitors.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (Nvidia)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Nvidia is front and center as the stock most affected by tariff concerns.

**Technicals:** Watching $110 level. Note that this is the lowest it's been since September 2024. We have millions of shares come in in the first 2 minutes of the open so watch for that.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Not much to speak of that hasn't been said before, but NVDA is heavily affected by tariffs and the CHIPS Act, with additional scrutiny that it is somehow bypassing export controls and having their chips go into China.

**Risks:** MORE trade disputes, more potential export restrictions, (Trump has cited he wants to strengthen export controls for NVDA).

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d) / [FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d) / Other Chinese Stocks

**Catalyst:** China has imposed 15% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S. goods.

**Technicals:** $130 level. Most interesting level I'm watching today.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Tariffs, stimulus from the Chinese government, China has been spending for increased consumer confidence. 

**Risks:** Even greater tariffs, the cash cannon that China is using dies down, less spending by Chinese consumers, etc.

**NVDA earnings today, will likely decide the fate of the immediate market. It reports at 4:20 ET today!**

**Catalyst:** Some catalysts today: Deepseek cuts API pricing by 75%, NVDA is reporting earnings, ChatGPT is doing a limited rollout of ChatGPT 4.5, META considering $200B AI data center.

NVDA reporting earnings is the main catalyst today and decides the immediate direction of the market.

**Technicals:** Mainly interested in seeing if NVDA misses revenue (unlikely) or if they say anything significant due to new export controls which I talked about yesterday (strengthening of CHIPS Act export controls to China).

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** NVDA leads in semis design, is a multi-billion dollar company, etc.

**Risks:** I'm currently positioned defensively (sold calls against my position since I have a decent cost basis from back when DeepSeek news released, so overall will just sit on hands and get out of my position if the earnings are bad).

**Related Tickers:** INTC, QCOM, ASML

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** (Old news) New report shows demand is falling in Europe, with sales dropping a precipitous 45% in January.

**Technicals:** Massive selloff since post-election highs- $300 was a significant level I was watching at the time and we exploded past that, so interested to see if we're able to hold above it.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** BYD is a major competitor to TSLA and will likely overtake them in the future, and Musk's political actions are seen as controversial in Europe.

**Risks:** Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD, and other auto stocks.

**Ticker:** [**COIN (Coinbase)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=COIN&p=d)**/**[**HOOD (Robinhood)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HOOD&p=d)**/**[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)**/Other CC Stocks**

**Catalyst:** The CC market is experiencing a selloff mainly due to proposed tariffs and the hack at Bybit, resulting in the loss of \~$1.5 billion.

**Technicals:** Not too interested in playing this long- still watching to see how we perform but the sell off has continued, waiting for a larger move still.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Hacks increase fear of storing on centralized exchanges (like Coinbase), proposed tariffs affecting digital assets can lead to market volatility. Interestingly enough, ByBit was (theorized) to be hacked by North Korea.

**Related Tickers:** MARA, RIOT

**Ticker:** [**BABA (Alibaba)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BABA&p=d)**/**[**FXI (iShares China Large-Cap ETF)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FXI&p=d)**/Chinese Stocks**

**Catalyst:** China plans to inject at least $55 billion into its largest banks in the coming months as part of a broader stimulus package, Yuan printer go brrrrr. This move is intended to supplement the core Tier 1 capital of China‚Äôs six largest state-owned banks. This is the first bank recapitalization since the global financial crisis. 10T yuan (\~$1.4T) debt package to support local government financing and economic stability.

**Technicals:** We've seen a decent upmove on a lot of Chinese stocks due to this, we'll see how the market reacts.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** China has been going through a spending crisis, and the government's decision to inject substantial capital into its major banks is a move to strengthen liquidity. This initiative aims to enhance the lending capacity of banks, support local government financing, and stabilize the broader economy. It's a (pre) bailout baby.

**Risks:** This does signal that China sees economic weakness, such as lack of demand due to their real estate sector they've traditionally leaned on for consumer growth/investment. Is this a long term fix? Who knows, but it worked for the US!

**Related Tickers:** JD, BIDU

**Ticker: SMCI**

**Catalyst:** They finally filed an hour before the deadline on the final day! Really cutting it close there lol. The company has faced¬†allegations of accounting irregularities. These allegations, along with a failure to file specific financial forms have been a plague for the past year on the stock price. 

**Technicals:** We've seen a 20% move AH, so worth watching at open to see if we move further. Other than that, watching $50/$55 level. We'll see where it goes but worth noting that we've made a significant move back to pre-delisting threat prices already.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Was at threat of delisting from the NASDAQ but now they're safe baby.

**Risks:** People getting out, or the filing being rejected/advised to resubmit. The latter is a massive catalyst but low probability.

Moving money from the US to foreign markets may be smart, but which? And a crash in the US tends to affect the entire world, so while they'd probably be safer, they won't be safe.

I pulled out of the US markets entirely last week before the 4 down days. I just put 1/3 of my portfolio into EUAD which is an ETF of some of the biggest European defense stocks.  I know I'm a few months late on this one. Europe is realizing that it can't count on the US anymore and will have to grow its own defense industry. I'm definitely willing to investigate and invest in smaller defense stocks too. I don't expect it to go nuts, because these are old established companies and their stocks don't move that fast, but I think it's a very safe bet that Europe's defense stocks are going to grow over the next few years.

What are some other examples of trying to adjust to the current situation? Short TSLA? Invest in other EV companies that take some of the post-TSLA hype?

I was young but I used to play a stock trading game on my ‚ÄúIBM Compatible‚Äù computer which really wasn‚Äôt but that is how they sold you computers back then.  It had a ticker that would scroll across the screen and you could buy and sell stocks in made up companies.

No one really knows where the stock market is heading the rest of the year but I could make a pretty good argument we are moving towards stagflation temporarily.  I can see a scenario of a weakening economy with persistent inflation.  So, if the market were to move negative the rest of the year, what are your picks to see the largest downside moves?

My picks:

TSLA - Obvious reasons‚Ä¶its stock prices is built on a dream that is becoming a nightmare
PINS - Low revenue growth outside the U.S, ADU growth slowing down, It is mostly ads now and almost unusable. 25B market came to 3.5B revenue.
SNAP - 11 years in and still can‚Äôt make a profit.  

Also, if federal grant money really does decline, and cuts to Medicaid, pick any public health care stock and buy puts.  If they cancel infrastructure contracts, pick most of the shovel companies like Caterpillar and buy puts.  If they cancel the farmer subsidies, buy puts in John Deere.  So many others that are going to be hurt.

1iu6l14,$META Quick Analysis,"There's alot to like here and the stock has alot further to go. Dont let the $700 price make you think ""its expensive"" because its not. Its one of the the cheapest of the Mag 7.

PE Ratios

META: 29

MSFT: 33

GOOGL: 23

AMZN: 40

NVDA: 55

TSLA: 172

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

1isn9yb,Portfolio Advice - 30yo and married,"Hey everyone, love this sub. I been working on rebalancing my portfolio and would love some thoughts - I primarily trimmed down my single stock picks into ETFs. 

I‚Äôm 30 and my wife is 27 - we have a NW of about 800K across brokerage and retirement accounts. 

Our breakdown is as follows across that 800K: 

- Vanguard ETFs (VOO/VGT): 567K (70%)
- TSLA: 100K (12.5%) 
- SOFI: 48K (6%)
- PLTR: 35K (4.3%)
- PYPL: 16K (2%)

- Cash + Gold: 30K

I recently trimmed down about half of both my TSLA and PLTR positions, and moved them into VOO/VGT. Feeling a lot better/safer with that decision, but would love some thoughts. I know TSLA is pretty hated on Reddit, but I do believe in their FSD and roadmap for the next few years. Moving forward, my contributions are going to be primarily towards building that Vanguard ETFs fund.",2025-02-18 20:49:47,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1isn9yb/portfolio_advice_30yo_and_married/
1iq3s4q,How Musk is using TSLA as a piggy bank,"Everyone knows it is a meme stock. By definition it would crash at some point. The trick is to make money while not ending up being the bag holder when it crashes.

But the stock won‚Äôt crash unless Musk starts selling. And he knows it too. So he is using the meme stock and meme coins as collateral to invest in real companies that actually have some realistic valuation. 

Musk sold $8.5 billion in Tesla shares to buy Twitter. The stock went down. He basically converted the meme stock to a real company. The banks underwrote that investment suffered losses but he used Twitter to buy the presidency. The banks lost money but gained favors like less regulations instead. Everyone is happy.

He contracts out TSLA stuff to his private companies like xAi.  XAi and Optimus have huge conflicts of interest. Both of them need the best AI talents. My guess is Optimus will end up being the hardware side of the business(nuts and bolts assembly) while the software and IPs will belong to XAi. And for every robot sold, there will be a license paid to XAi. If the board removes Musk, the licensing fee will go up making TSLA side of the business virtually worthless.

I am pretty sure the big investment banks know these things but they are given investment opportunities in his private businesses in exchange for their silence and their inflated analyst valuations. And they don‚Äôt want to shoot themselves in the foot having lent him huge sums of money.

People say Musk won‚Äôt let TSLA down because most of his wealth is tied to it. At this point he is milking TSLA for what it is worth. He is borrowing against inflated meme stock prices to buy real companies that are private. He is hedging against the inevitable TSLA crash. His lenders are going with the Ponzi scheme to mitigate the risk to their massive investment. Having borrowed heavily against TSLA shares Musk has no incentive to work for TSLA anymore.

If I have sizable TSLA holdings I would be nervously watching his latest  and totally random OpenAI cash offer of $98 billion or a potential tik tok bid. That means the stock will crater again if he sells stock, he may not care because by now he knows the game is up. Maybe it is triggered by BYD offering free FSD on 20k cars. And this time there might be no coming back. He might offer you first dibs on SpaceX ipo for holding worthless TSLA shares but it sure won‚Äôt be cheap.

Disclosure: I don‚Äôt have any positions on TSLA at this point.

1inb7p0,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I‚Äôm no Tesla expert, and I‚Äôm sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



üìâ Shrinking Profit Margins ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Musk‚Äôs PR Nightmare ‚Äì Elon literally gave a ‚ÄúSieg Heil‚Äù on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not exactly great for brand reputation.



üöó Cybertruck is a Mess ‚Äì Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it‚Äôs basically a meme.



üåç New Political & Tariff Risks ‚Äì Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



‚ö° Serious Competition is Catching Up ‚Äì Tesla isn‚Äôt the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching‚Äîor surpassing‚Äîthem in innovation.



üö¶ FSD is Overhyped ‚Äì Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla‚Äôs self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



üîã Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze ‚Äì Raw material costs are going up, and Trump‚Äôs tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



ü§ñ Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent ‚Äì Even before Musk‚Äôs latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla‚Äôs AI progress.



üîµ Losing Left-Leaning Consumers ‚Äì Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs‚Äîthey were miles ahead of everyone else. But that‚Äôs just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.



What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",2025-02-11 22:20:13,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inb7p0/tsla_isnt_the_nvidia_of_evs_anymore/
1in3m01,Full bearish on TSLA???,"Yeah, you heard me right: Musk's image is now quite disliked by many people‚Äîto the point that some are beginning to avoid buying Teslas just to avoid giving him money. I've also heard reports of Teslas being vandalized, with anti-Musk slogans carved into them.

Moreover, last quarter was seen by the market as disappointing, if not delusional, adding a financial component to the concerns. This could be a reason to adopt a bearish outlook on the stock.

1in2fl3,ELI5: what is risk to hold TSLQ for several months?,"Edit:  thanks for replies.  I think I understand better now, the concept of ""decay"" (due to volatility, rebalancing etc) and how an inverse ETF can go down even when the stock it's tracking also goes down.

New question:  let's say I'm willing to make a ""bet"" that TSLA goes down in the next 6-12mo... what is the simplest way for me to make that bet?  Do I really have to get into margin accts and short selling?  Basically I'd like to ""mirror"" TSLA for next 12mo.  Is there a simple way to do that or not really?

\---

I'm new to inverse ETFs and have a small position in TSLQ.  I do know that several 'warnings' say that these style investments are meant for intraday, but since it is an ETF I don't understand the risk of holding for weeks or months.  (apart from the obvious, if the tracking stock goes up)  So here's my question, if the hypothesis comes true (that TSLA goes down over next 6mo) what is the risk to just hold TSLQ ETF for that period?

Another way to ask, is there something else going on with the 'tracking' where over longer periods of time the ETF won't track to certain kinds of losses (eg; during after hours or something else...)?  Is it possible that TSLA goes down over a period of time but somehow TSLQ doesn't gain?

Sorry if this is remedial or breaks any rules please let me know... I'm genuinely confused after reading different things about inverse ETF risks.",2025-02-11 16:21:54,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1in2fl3/eli5_what_is_risk_to_hold_tslq_for_several_months/

Alphabet down 7% in the past month. Google Cloud miss & high Capex

TSLA down 8% with weak EV deliveries

Apple down 7% YTD. iPhone sales down 1%, China revenue down 11%, revenue growth of just ""low to mid single digits"" for the upcoming quarter 

NVIDIA down 6% YTD. DeepSeek's cost-effective model raises questions

Amazon down 4% after releasing earnings recently. AWS results came in lower than expected & guidance for next quarter's revenue & profit came up short

Curious what others go from here. For some long-term investors, it's a dip for a buying opportunity. Some might stay away given limited upside with DeepSeek, high Capex, and softer revenue growth.

News: [Us Initial Jobless Claims Pick Up But Stay Relatively Low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/us-initial-jobless-claims-pick-up-but-stay-relatively-low)

**Ticker:** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Ford Motor Company reports .39 vs .34 expected, revenue of $48.2 vs 43.6B expected. Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.

**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.

**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).

**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.

**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.

**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)

**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.

**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.

**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.

**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.

**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).

**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).

**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.

**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.

**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).

**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.

**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.

**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a ""mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.""

**Offhand Comments: A lot of the firms that manufacture parts for the iPhone are linked in performance, especially if the iPhone is the main source of their sales- would be interesting to formulate some trading ideas from that.**

**Related Tickers:** QCOM, AVGO, TXN.

1ih835v,Tesla‚Äôs Valuation: Speculation or Real Growth? My DCF Insights,"I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here‚Äôs what I found. I don‚Äôt own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&P. However, with recent events, I‚Äôve been wondering why people hold TSLA.

My typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs a way to get started.

For TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.

With these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.

Now, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.

With all that said, it‚Äôs hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?

Congrats to all the long-term holders who have made a killing! I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on this.",2025-02-04 03:09:52,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ih835v/teslas_valuation_speculation_or_real_growth_my/

We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.

~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~

# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)

>President¬†Donald Trump¬†President¬†Donald Trump¬†said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,‚Äù Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

>‚ÄúNumber one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we‚Äôre giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,‚Äù he said.

>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day‚Äôs high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels ‚Äúmay or may not rise with time.‚Äù

>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import ‚Äî oil ‚Äî would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,‚Äù Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

>Trump‚Äôs move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn‚Äôt specify the levy, though he‚Äôs previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

>‚ÄúWith China, I‚Äôm also thinking about something because they‚Äôre sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they‚Äôre causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,‚Äù Trump said Thursday. ‚ÄúSo China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we‚Äôre in the process of doing that.‚Äù

>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world‚Äôs second largest economy.

>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

>‚ÄúIf these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,‚Äù Canadian Ambassador to the US¬†Kirsten Hillman¬†said Thursday. ‚ÄúThis is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It‚Äôs not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it‚Äôs not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.‚Äù

>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump‚Äôs concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

>Canadian Prime Minister¬†Justin Trudeau¬†visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President¬†Claudia Sheinbaum¬†spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers¬†Ford Motor Co.¬†and¬†General Motors Co.¬†turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

>‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs tariffs will tax America first,‚Äù Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. ‚ÄúFrom higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.‚Äù

>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

>He‚Äôs hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,‚Äù Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

>‚ÄúNumber one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we‚Äôre giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,‚Äù he said.

>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day‚Äôs high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

1ido021,These are the stocks on my watchlist (01/30),"This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

**Related tickers:** (Mentioned above)

# [S&P 500 futures rise after Meta Platforms, Tesla report earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company‚Äôs quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple‚Äôs results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains ‚Äúsomewhat elevated.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúThe implication is that we‚Äôre on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it‚Äôs probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn‚Äôt be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,‚Äù Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúWe have a relatively stable place where we‚Äôre standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,‚Äù he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday‚Äôs personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

1ickhww,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company‚Äôs in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk‚Äôs Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone‚Äôs latest software update ‚Äî released Monday ‚Äî now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.‚Äù Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will ‚Äúbegin with select optimized smartphones‚Äù and that the full launch will ‚Äúsupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.‚Äù T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there‚Äôs been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple‚Äôs 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has ‚Äúhad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.‚Äù

>

>Here‚Äôs how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple‚Äôs Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There‚Äôs another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically ‚Äî even when the phone is in a customer‚Äôs pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don‚Äôt have cellular service. The capabilities can‚Äôt be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple‚Äôs announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn‚Äôt disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile‚Äôs cellular network in November.

1ib78ft,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",2025-01-27 12:06:13,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ib78ft/the_case_for_tsla_the_business_value/
1i8w8mw,TSLA - will Musk step back as CEO?,"Since he is currently focusing on other activities being involved with the US government, it might be that he will step back as CEO. Maybe his latest actions were on purpose, so that he can be officially removed by the TSLA shareholders. Do you think it might be beneficial for TSLA if he leaves? Do you think it is even possible that he leaves?

I do not hold any TSLA shares atm.

EDIT: Might some of the opinions have changed?",2025-01-24 14:10:57,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8w8mw/tsla_will_musk_step_back_as_ceo/
1i8diqm,Reddit ETF progress from Jan 2021 to Jan 2025,"This [Reddit ETF post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ku6skz/reddit_etf/) was made at the beginning of 2021, near the period of peak euphoria.  Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*

Oh.   Though I must admit that I was caught off guard by the comeback it is mounting.  Reddit ETF went up 69% in 2024 and is closing in on VTI.

1i6tlc3,"Does a fairly large earnings miss stop a,stock's incredible momentum for the intermediate future?","I understand that a big earnings miss,will weaken a,stock's momentum.. Mathematically that is obvious

 BUT what i am asking is if NVDA/TSLA/LLY/Planatir/etc. have big earnings,miss, can the stock price shake it off and continue an incredible bullish run.. Or is,that generally the end of the extraordinary stock run?

In recnt times, it seems like the 4 stocks i mentioned had really amazing runs (very little precedence i'd say,for,such huge runs over,a medium length period, and eapecially for mega-caps)..  w‚Äãas there very little bad news,associated with them? Or,did investors create their bubble-like returns to some degree absent specific good news much of the time (i mean absence,of bi-weekly specific good news)

Something I've wondered for awhile.. Surprisingly i have not seen a research paper on this subject?

Right i am wondering this,about Tesla in particular.. NVDA and LLY have slowed alot.. And Planitir not a key stock

I do know AAPL didn't have a meaningful earnings miss for a long time.. 10 years or so

Thanks in adance.. I am very interested in stock theory, backteating and research papers (academic or practitioner)

1i6ij9n,XPEL: Analyzing Growth Potential in the Automotive Market,"Here‚Äôs my condensed analysis of XPEL: FYI: I focus on uncovering companies with strong growth potential and sharing my insights.

**Note:** All hyperlinks will lead you to direct source material 

**Disclaimer:** I **DO NOT** own shares of XPEL at the time of writing

I would love to hear from the community and have a in-depth conversation from ya'll. Thank you & enjoy!

# Macro Overview:

**Electric Vehicle Growth**

The U.S. EV market is projected to show annual growth of 10.54% from 2025-2029, resulting in a market value of $156.3 billion by 2029 [according to Statista.](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) Unit sales alone are projected to reach 2.32 million units by 2029 as well. Consumers now have significantly more choices when shopping for an electric vehicle. They can choose from offerings by [Tesla](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/), [GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/), [Honda](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HMC/), Hyundai, and many others.

EV's often have unique aesthetic and maintenance needs that typically have high-quality protective films and coatings. The growth in consumer adoption of EV's coincides with Xpel products, particularly on the impact in the aftermarket. EV owners value vehicle preservation. This creates a growing market share for XPEL'S products. These products also include heat-reducing window films that indirectly enhance battery performance.

**Aging Vehicles**

The average car or truck on the road in the U.S in 2024, was more than 12.6 years old, a new record according to [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/fuel-for-thought-average-age-vehicles-2024.html#:~:text=Vehicles%20on%20the%20road%20are,by%20two%20months%20over%202023.). Consumers now choose to keep cars longer than they used to. This is largely because of the increases in new vehicle prices. As these older vehicles age, the demand for general maintenance and preservation are more-likely to rise.

Car price increases have climbed for four consecutive months, according to [Kelley Blue Book data](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/after-4-straight-months-price-increases-new-car-now-costs-nearly-50000). As of December 2024, the average price of a new vehicle was $49,740, the second-highest level ever recorded. Economic uncertainty and higher costs can discourage new purchases. This situation favors repairs and maintenance of existing vehicles as the fleet continues to get older before replacement.

**Technological advancements**

[Self-healing films](https://www.xpel.com/products/paint-protection-film/ultimate-plus?srsltid=AfmBOopjFd4lU0Io05gEI-r8EsK9Z7gIDE7DRjI1mI7yEhQAFqPDeofN) from XPEL and competitors [3M](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MMM/), [Eastman Performance Films](https://www.eastman.com/en/who-we-are/locations/fieldale-va-usa), and [STEK Automotive](https://www.stekautomotive.com/) were released much earlier. They have recently gained traction as consumers want paint protection film to protect their vehicles. Self-healing films use polymer capable of automatically repairing minor scratches and abrasions when exposed to heat. As vehicles on the road become increasingly older, the demand for reduced effort in maintaining a vehicle's exterior will increase. Vehicle owners will likely seek easier maintenance solutions with minimal effort that repel against water, dirt, and scratches more easily. Consumers and manufacturers are increasingly adopting self-healing films. People who want to protect their older vehicles find XPEL appealing. It is also chosen to keep luxury cars in pristine condition.

# Investment Thesis:

XPEL is a compelling investment with an attractive growth story in the automotive sector. It is supported by a strong brand presence, international expansion growth, and financial strength. With high expectations, investors should take notice in the premium valuation risks apparent. Long-term growth is certainly compelling but there are clear short-term headwinds including macroeconomic uncertainties that require careful monitoring.

* **Product Diversification:** XPEL is widely known for their paint protection films. These films contribute to 70% of total Q3 sales and grew by 2.7%. Still, products like their window film and ceramic coatings have outperformed with growth of 20.6%. [Non-automotive products](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_presentations/2024/11/Q3-2024-XPEL-Investor-Presentation.pdf) like home & office window films, antimicrobial film, and niche surface protection film also out-performed by 11.6%. Together, both segments contributed 30% to total sales. Impressive growth outperformance though has largely been a significant reason for overall revenue growth in recent quarters.
* **International Expansion:** U.S. sales are the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for 57.2% of the total and reaching $64.6 million in Q3, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.4%. Despite the reliance on U.S. sales, International sales continue to outperform. Canada is the second largest contributor at 12.8% of revenue with growth of 25.7% to $14.4 million. All international markets saw growth except for the third largest market which is China. China saw a significant decline of -11.6% to just $9.06 million. The decrease was primarily attributed to XPEL's distributor working through excess inventory levels. With only a weighting of 8% of total sales, the negative growth did not hurt overall sales significantly. While XPEL faced challenges in China as well as minor growth of 4.1% and 1.4% in Europe and the U.K, strong international performance lead to record revenue.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** XPEL has established multiple strategic partnerships to expand its market presence. Recent collaborations with brands like [Tesla](https://lp.xpel.com/tesla-window-film), [Kia](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), exclusive [Rivian](https://s204.q4cdn.com/619560229/files/doc_news/XPEL-and-Rivian-Expand-Collaboration-With-New-PPF-and-Window-Film-Program-2024.pdf) supplier partnership, [BMW](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030688212/en/XPEL-Showcases-New-Products-and-Collaborations-at-SEMA-2024), and [Team Penske](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2024/07/10/xpel-partners-with-team-penske-to-protect-indycars-and-drivers/) have been formed. These collaborations, including with service providers like [Tint World](https://www.tintworld.com/news-media/news-and-press/industry-leaders-tint-world-and-xpel-announce-partnership/), have strengthened market presence. Brand visibility and revenue growth have also increased as a result. The Tesla partnership in particular is of major importance due to their dominance in the EV market. These recent collaborations integrate XPEL's wide array of products into solutions for high-profile vehicles and events. The partnerships with Tesla and Rivian are particularly significant. They expand their reach into the electric vehicle market that continues to rapidly grow in the U.S. and internationally.

# Risk Factors:

* **Reliance On Chinese Distribution:** [Potential tariff threats to China](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-importers-rush-goods-china-trump-tariff-threat-looms-2025-01-15/) from a new administration will significantly impact XPEL if enacted. If new tariffs are applied, XPEL will be faced with increases in far materials leading to higher production costs. With the U.S market as the largest source of revenue at 57.2%, passing on further costs to consumers would likely reduce demand. Most importantly, reliance on one distributor could lead to supply chain constraints due to an over-reliance on one company. Price increases or delayed deliveries would harm relationships and hurt XPEL's brand.
* **The Culper Research Short Report:** On October 19, 2023, [Culper Research issued a short report](https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/cc91fda7-4669-4d1b-81ce-a0b8d77f25ab/downloads/Culper_XPEL_10-19-2023.pdf?ver=1733419998410) sending XPEL's stock retreating -17.3% from $51.51 per share to $42.61. A notable accusation was XPEL's understated reliance on Tesla. [XPEL responded](https://ppfmag.com/short-seller-targets-xpel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) by stating Tesla represented just 5% of 2023 revenue. Secondly, Culper believes XPEL is concealing a massive risk. Their primary supplier, ""Entrotech, Inc"", has formed a [joint venture with PPG Industries](https://news.ppg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/PPG-launches-paint-films-solutions-for-automotive-and-industrial-customers/default.aspx) on May 23, 2023. Lastly, Culper's claim as seen below, would have massive repercussions for XPEL if they are correct.
* **Additional Culper Info:** The validity of Culper's claims on XPEL and others have been [called into question many times](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/827876/000166357721000030/ex99_1.htm) for self-benefiting public statements. What we do know for sure is the joint venture with PPG Industries is in fact truthful. The extent of which XPEL will become obsolete on the other is a highly questionable take. For some reason, Culper did not mention that XPEL stands out due to their DAP software. It is not because of the PPF raw material. Hence, XPEL would know exactly how much material and company their products were installed on. These allegations were made in 2023. XPEL has continued to show strong growth. The company has not skipped a beat.

# Conclusion

XPEL offers an attractive growth story in the automotive industry. This growth is supported by their strong market position and international expansion. The company also has a diverse product portfolio and strategic partnerships. A P/E ratio of 23.98 certainly wouldn't be viewed as cheap by any measures. Still, their P/E is significantly below their five-year average P/E of 41.6. Long-term growth remains compelling with the expectation of double-digit growth in the next two years.

Nonetheless, there are near-term headwinds. Sure, XPEL has displayed a history of growth, but near-term macroeconomic uncertainties regarding tariff concerns are worth monitoring. XPEL must consider how to react to such challenges since their distributor is based in China. For the reasons noted above, we still believe XPEL is a compelling BUY. It offers long-term sustainable growth, strategic partnerships, international expansion, and a strong balance sheet.",2025-01-21 13:26:39,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i6ij9n/xpel_analyzing_growth_potential_in_the_automotive/

1i0t3rb,China Discusses Sale of TikTok US to Musk as One Possible Option,"Bloomberg: Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves¬†Elon Musk¬†acquiring the US operations of TikTok if the company fails to fend off a controversial ban on the short-video app, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing officials strongly prefer that TikTok remains under the ownership of parent¬†ByteDance Ltd., the people say, and the company is contesting the impending ban with an appeal to the US Supreme Court. But the justices signaled during arguments on Jan. 10 that¬†they are likely¬†to uphold the law. Senior Chinese officials had already begun to debate contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with¬†Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, one of which involves Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified revealing confidential discussions.

A potential high-profile deal with one of Trump‚Äôs closest allies holds some appeal for the Chinese government, which is expected to have some say over whether TikTok is ultimately sold, said the people. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump‚Äôs re-election, and has been tapped for a prominent role in improving government efficiency after the Republican takes office.

Under one scenario that‚Äôs been discussed by the Chinese government, Musk‚Äôs X ‚Äî the former Twitter ‚Äî would take control of TikTok US and run the businesses together, the people said. With more than 170 million users in the US, TikTok could bolster X‚Äôs efforts to attract advertisers. Musk also founded a separate artificial intelligence company, xAI, that could benefit from the huge amounts of data generated from TikTok.

Chinese officials have yet to reach any firm consensus about how to proceed and their deliberations are still preliminary, the people said. It‚Äôs not clear how much ByteDance knows about the Chinese government discussions or whether TikTok and Musk have been involved. It‚Äôs also unclear whether Musk, TikTok and ByteDance have held any talks about the terms of any possible deal.

Musk and his representatives did not respond to a request for comment. Musk¬†posted in April¬†that he thinks TikTok should remain available in the US. ‚ÄúIn my opinion, TikTok should not be banned in the USA, even though such a ban may benefit the X platform,‚Äù he wrote on X. ‚ÄúDoing so would be contrary to freedom of speech and expression. It is not what America stands for.‚Äù

ByteDance and TikTok representatives didn‚Äôt respond to messages seeking comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China and China‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce, government agencies that could be involved in decisions about TikTok‚Äôs future, also didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.

The talks in Beijing suggest that TikTok‚Äôs fate may no longer be in ByteDance‚Äôs sole control, said the people. Chinese officials recognize they will face tough negotiations with the Trump administration over tariffs, export controls and other issues, and they see the TikTok negotiations as a potential area for reconciliation, they said.

The Chinese government holds a so-called golden share in a ByteDance affiliate that gives it influence over the company‚Äôs strategy and operations. TikTok maintains that the control only applies to the China-based subsidiary Douyin Information Service Co., and has no bearing on ByteDance operations outside China. Still, Beijing‚Äôs export rules prevent Chinese companies from selling their software algorithms, like the one integral to TikTok. Because the Chinese government would have to approve of a sale that includes TikTok‚Äôs valuable recommendation engine, it has a significant voice in any possible deal.

TikTok‚Äôs US operations could be valued at¬†around $40 billion to $50 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Mandeep Singh and Damian Reimertz estimated last year. That‚Äôs a substantial sum even for the world‚Äôs richest person. It‚Äôs not clear how Musk could pull off such a transaction, whether it would require the sale of other holdings, or whether the US government would approve. He paid $44 billion for Twitter in 2022, and is still paying off sizable loans.

Musk has a positive reputation among many ByteDance employees in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. He is seen as a very successful entrepreneur, who has experience engaging with the Chinese government through his¬†Tesla Inc.¬†business, the person added.

ByteDance‚Äôs leaders have repeatedly said their priority is to fight US legislation that requires the Beijing-based company sell or shut down the US operations because of national security concerns. TikTok‚Äôs lawyers have argued the legislation violates free speech laws under the Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment.

A majority of the Supreme Court justices suggested the security concerns take priority over free speech, although they have yet to issue a formal decision. President-elect Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has sought to delay the TikTok ban ‚Äî which takes effect Jan. 19 ‚Äî so he can work on the negotiations. He has said he wants to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the app and there‚Äôs been speculation he could take last-minute action to sidestep the ban.

On a practical level, spinning off TikTok‚Äôs US business would be highly complex, affecting shareholders in China as well as the US. Lawyers for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court that separating the US portions of the product would be ‚Äúextraordinarily difficult.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unclear if US TikTok would be sold off in a competitive process, or if a sale would be arranged by the government. Billionaire Frank McCourt and ‚ÄúShark Tank‚Äù investor Kevin O‚ÄôLeary are part of a bid through Project Liberty to acquire TikTok, which O‚ÄôLeary has¬†said he¬†discussed with Trump. In the past,¬†Microsoft Corp.¬†had sought to acquire the business, and¬†Oracle Corp.¬†has a deep technology partnership with the company.

One alternative for TikTok would be to move its existing US customers over to a similar app ‚Äî with different branding ‚Äî to potentially sidestep the ban, one of the people said. It‚Äôs not clear how effective such a move would be.

One person close to the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the strategy, said before the Supreme Court hearing that the legal battle is still the focus of top executives and they would prefer to keep fighting in the US rather than sell TikTok US and cede control for good.

Musk is in a position to influence the China-US relationship as the world‚Äôs richest person with businesses that straddle the world‚Äôs two largest economies. Tesla, where Musk is chief executive officer, erected a sprawling factory in Shanghai in 2019 and has since expanded the facility into the company‚Äôs largest production base. The effort helped Tesla expand its market share in China despite tough local competition, and build goodwill with government officials.

While Trump is staffing his incoming administration with China hawks like Secretary of State nominee¬†Marco Rubio, Musk has spoken out against some recent China trade policies, including the Biden administration‚Äôs tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.

**Thoughts:** Obviously this type of news has the ability to move TSLA/META/social networks. We've seen TSLA make moves from political news, SpaceX news, Twitter news, and TSLA trades as a proxy to whatever Elon Musk is doing at the time even if it's not directly applicable to TSLA as a company.

1hte6xi,Arcadium Lithium says shareholders approved Rio Tinto deal,"Shareholders of Arcadium Lithium have given the green light for a $6.7 billion sale to Australian mining heavyweight Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), as announced by the company on Monday.

This news was met with positivity in the stock market, with Arcadium's shares climbing over 2% in after-hours trading.

However, the path to the deal is not without its obstacles. Arcadium is currently dealing with legal challenges from a section of its shareholders.

These shareholders have lodged lawsuits against the company, accusing it of misrepresentation, concealment, and negligence in relation to the takeover deal. This information was disclosed by Arcadium in a regulatory filing earlier this month.

Earlier in the year, Rio Tinto stated its intention to acquire Arcadium at a price of $5.85 per share, which was paid in cash. This purchase price represented a nearly 90% premium on Arcadium's closing stock price on October 4, the day a potential deal was first reported by Reuters.

The acquisition will grant Rio Tinto access to Arcadium's lithium mines, processing facilities, and deposits located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

Additionally, Rio Tinto will also inherit Arcadium's customer base, which includes major automotive manufacturers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG), and General Motors (NYSE:GM).",2025-01-04 13:17:56,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hte6xi/arcadium_lithium_says_shareholders_approved_rio/
1ht9qr5,Is it worth it to invest time into learning technical analysis? ,"For context, I've been buying stocks and options since I turned 18 around 3 months ago, so I don't have a lot of experience or knowledge in the first place. I've just been making moves based on my own research combined with other people's ideas. I was looking through a discord where people share their ideas as I wanted to expand my portfolio past being 65% NVDA and 35% random bullshit, and I often see these pictures of daily 5 minute candles with countless horizontal, diagonal, and curvy lines. The poster then mentions various names for some candlestick patterns and says something about how the stock closed above/under the EMA or some crap then proceeds to justify their following move, seeming to have full confidence because of this chart they drew.

So I thought, if I could go by the book and use rules and numbers to get a solid guess on which way the stock's gonna go, I'd be rich. But if it were that easy, everyone would be rich. And one look through this r/wallstreetbets makes it clear that there's not a lot of people who have achieved that status.

I'm posting to ask if learning about all this is worth it. I know that the market is unpredictable and there's no way looking at a bunch of lines will give me a positive winrate, but does it help? For example, could you have a better chance at guessing what's gonna happen in the next 30 minutes if you recognized the pattern that came before it? I know that I cannot expect the book to be right all the time, but would it at least give me a better shot at it?

I haven't tried this at all and so far I've been doing fine, though I know the stuff I've bought have been nice to me in the months I've held it and I can't expect the same in the future (I started with 7k, now at 9k, with 50% of gains unrealized from mostly NVDA and RKLB, 50% of gains realized from TSLA and NVDA calls bought post-election). I know reading these patterns won't help in the long run, as I'm holding shares and am not planning to sell in the foreseeable future, but I want to understand what these people are talking about when they do TAs and try it for myself to see if it actually helps or not. Maybe try buying 0dte for SPY and QQQ to harvest some loss porn for WSB.

Thanks in advance.",2025-01-04 08:04:26,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ht9qr5/is_it_worth_it_to_invest_time_into_learning/

1hbf2zb,Siemens - worth a look? A balanced view.,"Purpose of this post is to get a sense of 'sentiment' about Siemens. It's not a lazy $hit post, asking ""what do y'all think yo""? But yeah, essentially, that's what I am asking, besides listing down a long list of pros and cons of the company.

I've no position yet (long or short), but thinking of it.

Pros:

1. The conglomerate needs no introduction. There's virtually NO piece of any complex, industrial machinery (boats, planes, turbines, large diesel engines, data center infrastructure, heating, cooling, all kinds of factories, power plant, high voltage transformer...) that doesn't have at least a few critical components made by Siemens. The company stands to benefit from **energy transition, mobility, urbanization** (smart cities), and is focused on **high-margin** specialized components.
2. Valuations: 18 PE, 1.9 PS [Siemens AG - Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SIE:ETR?window=YTD)
3. News: there's plenty of positive news and developments [Google News ](https://news.google.com/search?for=siemens&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) Most notably, partnership with NVDA for industrial robotics applications. Won a few contracts in the middle East. 
4. Gaining momentum: for last 10 days at least, the trading volume is virtually all **BUY volume**. BUY volume means the trades were executed at 'ask' price. Buyers had to up their bids to get hands on the stock.
5. Low retail concentration: only 19% retail shareholders. Less susceptible to 'crowd' thinking. It's not your GME or TSLA which will up/down 10% in a day. Movements will be very slow and steady. In other words, low volatality. It's a steady wealth builder with 14% YTD; don't expect 500% in 5 years.

Cons:

1. German company. Yes, yes, we know Germany is in recession, aging population, generally hard business climate.. etc etc. But the company's operations are global. The only geographical 'risk' is, you've a stock in EUR currency, not traded as ADR on US exchange (as far as I know). Revenues come from all over the world, in many currencies.
2. Lot of competition: ABB, GE, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Larsen & Toubro.. may not be retail, well known names, but they all do the same stuff, some better; some worse. It's all about winning a large government / private contracts.",2024-12-10 23:07:41,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hbf2zb/siemens_worth_a_look_a_balanced_view/
1hb39my,Google shares rise on new quantum chip breakthrough,"

Shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.

Pichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, ""We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.""

The new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.
This development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. 

The goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.

The announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, ""wow,"" on social media platform X.

The Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications.",2024-12-10 14:42:37,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hb39my/google_shares_rise_on_new_quantum_chip/

1gtwjvx,Trump Team Is Seeking to Ease US Rules for Self-Driving Cars,"[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2024/11/17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars/)

  
TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department‚Äôs priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect‚Äôs inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren‚Äôt authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump‚Äôs team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said.¬†

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk‚Äôs plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment.¬†

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla‚Äôs third-quarter earnings call, saying he‚Äôd use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to ‚Äúdismantle government bureaucracy‚Äù and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump‚Äôs first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",2024-11-18 04:22:41,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtwjvx/trump_team_is_seeking_to_ease_us_rules_for/

1gak7c4,Tesla shares jump 6% on profit beat,"* Tesla¬†reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts‚Äô estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:**¬†72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:**¬†$25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected

Revenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.

Tesla‚Äôs profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.

Automotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.

Operating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.

# 

Tesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.

# More than just EVs

Tesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. ""As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,"" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.

# Balance sheet

Tesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.

**SUMMARY**

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles ‚Äì including more affordable models ‚Äì which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our ""We, Robot"" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",2024-10-23 20:16:25,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gak7c4/tesla_shares_jump_6_on_profit_beat/
1ga9gk5,Alphabet To $7 Trillion By 2025?,"We believe Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is positioned to grow its valuation by well over 3x from the already huge $2-trillion figure now ‚Äì potentially becoming the world‚Äôs most valuable company by a huge margin ‚Äì as its often-overlooked Waymo autonomous driving business quietly revolutionizes the transportation sector. This would take the stock to over $500 a share. Here‚Äôs why.

Fact: Waymo has grown the number of weekly paid rides from 10,000 to over 100,000 in the last 12 months. It went from 50,000 weekly rides to 100,000 just in the last six months.

The growth is compelling and the addressable market is massive

Case in point: Uber does more than 200 million rides each week. Let‚Äôs let that sink in. So if autonomous rides can capture even half that market, that would mean 100 million rides per week. That‚Äôs about 1,000 times where Waymo is today. 200 million rides a week translates to about a billion a month and over 10 billion a year. At $30 per ride, we‚Äôre talking revenues of close to $300 billion per year.

But wait‚Ä¶ there is more to the growth story

If Waymo is already delivering over 100,000 driverless rides, how many more people might switch from driving their cars to being driven by autonomous vehicles? The shift could be massive. For each person hailing a cab, there are at least 10 others driving their own cars. Many of these drivers might reconsider once they see millions of people relaxing in the back seat, streaming Netflix, while they‚Äôre stuck behind the wheel.

In fact, early data backs this up. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo is already retaining riders at a higher rate compared to other ride-hailing services like Uber or Lyft. People enjoy the experience of autonomous vehicles. Safety could also be another attraction. Waymo published a report last year indicating that its autonomous vehicles achieved an 85% reduction in injury-causing crashes compared to national rates for human-operated cars.

Investors will soon recognize that the $300 billion revenue figure for the current ride-hailing market has substantial growth potential ‚Äì it could easily expand by 2-3x. A $1 trillion market for autonomous rides isn‚Äôt out of the question. This growth would also translate to significant revenue opportunities for automakers like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which are working on their driverless vehicle technologies.

But wait aren‚Äôt so many automakers and tech players working on autonomous driving?

Yes, but not all of them are making the same progress. Waymo has a head start in the market. Its main competitor, General Motor‚Äôs backed Cruise lost its driverless permits in California after a serious accident, making Waymo the only publicly available robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving taxi program about six years ago and has partnered with Waymo to bring its services to the Uber app in some cities. While electric vehicle behemoth Tesla is seen as a leader of sorts in the self-driving space, given its large base of vehicles, it is only slowly getting into the space after the unveiling of its Robotaxi vehicle earlier this month.

Waymo has some advantages in terms of tech as well. It uses a fleet equipped with high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, creating a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And don‚Äôt forget Google‚Äôs got a secret weapon. It crowdsources annotated data such as CAPTCHA codes from its massive user base, using that to train its machine-learning models. That‚Äôs a big advantage in terms of understanding complex driving environments.

The best part?

These are self-driving cars ‚Äì no human drivers, no unions, no employee or contractor issues, and no human cost. While there will be other expenses, such as software development and battery costs, the absence of driver wages could lead to exceptionally high margins. Margins of 50% aren‚Äôt unrealistic when you consider that driver earnings account for a substantial portion of gross fares in traditional ride-hailing models.

If Waymo can capture about one-third of the $1 trillion autonomous rides market, it could generate annual revenues of around $300 billion. With a 50% margin, that‚Äôs a neat $150 billion in profits. What‚Äôs that worth? At a 30x earnings multiple, that would imply an additional valuation of about $4.5 trillion for Alphabet. Considering that Alphabet is worth roughly $2 trillion presently, this could take the company‚Äôs market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or over $500 per share.

To be sure, building this sort of scale can take a good deal of time ‚Äì quite different from signing up for say a Google or Netflix account. However, investors will need to look well out into the future. Think 2030 (not 2025), maybe even more. The point is not to get stuck ‚Äì if you‚Äôre concerned, look even further out, say 2035! The bottom line: Alphabet is growing Waymo quickly, has the technology and competitive edge, and is addressing a potentially massive market, making this high valuation within reach.

1g221z2,"Ride-sharing giants Uber, Lyft jump after Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äòtoothless taxi‚Äô fails to excite investors","Tesla‚Äôs hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber‚Äôs ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.

Uber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday‚Äôs event ‚Äî particularly slumping in early August and mid-September ‚Äî but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.

That is a massive turnaround for Uber‚Äôs stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla‚Äôs shares are plunging during Friday‚Äôs trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.

The buzz around Tesla‚Äôs highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company‚Äôs failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.

‚ÄúTSLA‚Äôs toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,‚Äù Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress","Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company‚Äôs long-awaited robotaxi event ‚Äî where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm‚Äôs Cybercab self-driving concept car ‚Äî failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla‚Äôs Cybercab concept vehicle ‚Äî a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals ‚Äî on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have ‚Äúunsupervised FSD‚Äù up and running in Texas and California next year in the company‚Äôs Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla‚Äôs premium driver assistance system, available today in a ‚Äúsupervised‚Äù version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk‚Äôs vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

‚ÄúAs expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla‚Äôs growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],‚Äù Barclays‚Äô U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

‚ÄúYet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn‚Äôt show its low-cost model planned for 1H‚Ä≤25 production,‚Äù they added. ‚ÄúWe also didn‚Äôt get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.‚Äù

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that ‚Äúmost trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,‚Äù the investment bank‚Äôs analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank‚Äôs analysts noted that Musk didn‚Äôt mention any details on improvements to Tesla‚Äôs FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk‚Äôs AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event ‚Äúoverall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,‚Äù Morgan Stanley‚Äôs analysts wrote in a note Friday.

‚ÄúWe were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,‚Äù they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google‚Äôs Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",2024-10-11 12:19:27,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g18fon/tesla_shares_drop_6_in_premarket_after_cybercab/
1g0067z,Any of you buying into Musk's robotaxi announcement tomorrow?,"Seems like every other major autoindustry and freight players already has some sort of autonomous fleet in the works and on the streets.  
TSLA does have an advantage of ai + their cameras + tons of real world auto driving data, but they lack lidar.

Could it be that Tesla's version of robotaxi will use something like tech from AUR, MBLY, LAZR?

1fuftc7,"Tesla stock slips after it reports 462,890 total deliveries during the third quarter","Tesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell about 2% in premarket trading after the report.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890

Total production Q3 2024: 469,796

Analysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ending Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.

Deliveries are not defined in Tesla‚Äôs financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It‚Äôs one of the most closely-watched metrics on Wall Street.

In the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.

Tesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.

In the U.S., EV competitors like Rivian are maturing, while legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are selling more electric vehicles after walking back more ambitious goals for electrification.

GM this week reported a roughly 60% increase in EV sales for the third quarter from a year earlier. Still, its electric business is tiny compared to Tesla‚Äôs, with just 32,100 units sold in the latest period, accounting for 4.9% of the company‚Äôs total sales.

Ford plans to report results on Wednesday.

Tesla hasn‚Äôt issued specific guidance for 2024 deliveries, but executives have said they expect a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last despite the company having added a new vehicle, the angular stainless steel Cybertruck, to their lineup.

The company also said on Wednesday that it deployed 6.9 GWh of energy storage products in the quarter.

Shares of Tesla climbed 32% in the third quarter, erasing their loss for the year in the process. The stock is now up almost 4% in 2024, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 19%.

Tesla‚Äôs brand has been under pressure in the U.S. due in part to the antics of CEO Elon Musk, who, in addition to endorsing former President Donald Trump, has shared what the White House called ‚Äúracist hate,‚Äù and false claims about immigrants and election fraud on X, his social media app.

But Tesla still sells more battery electric vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker, with Hyundai a distant second.

In its third-quarter earnings report later this month, investors will be particularly focused on profit margins.

Tesla has continued to offer attractive financing options and an array of incentives to drive sales volume in recent months in China as well as in the U.S. Prior to earnings, Tesla will host a marketing event on Oct. 10, and is expected to show off the design of ‚Äúdedicated robotaxi.‚Äù

Musk has promised Tesla self-driving cars for years, but the company has yet to deliver. Meanwhile competitors like Waymo and Pony.ai have begun operating commercial robotaxi services.

1ftqqw0,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so**¬†***Maybe***¬†**we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time. 

**My Prediction? GSPC/SPY cruise up a tiny bit further, to +/- $5900/$590 -- before retreating to $3500/$350 by 12/2025.**

1fqk8k6,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.‚Äôs TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company‚Äôs self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla‚Äôs FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a ‚Äúsafety disaster‚Äù and ‚Äúgalaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,‚Äù said GLJ Research‚Äôs Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla‚Äôs competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.‚Äôs GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.‚Äôs GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.‚Äôs BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla‚Äôs camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is ‚Äúsuspect.‚Äù In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. ‚ÄúIn fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,‚Äù it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. ‚ÄúThe most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,‚Äù it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California¬†Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.‚Äôs** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI‚Äôs statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn‚Äôt yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It‚Äôs Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla‚Äôs FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the ‚Äúliability of putting something this dangerous on roads.‚Äù

  
According to Ark‚Äôs valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla‚Äôs revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

# [Stock futures are flat after two straight down days for S&P 500, Nasdaq: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were flat Thursday as Wall Street looks to regain momentum after a rocky start to September. Key labor market data is also on deck this week.
*****
> Futures for the S&P 500 were up marginally, while Nasdaq 100 futures hovered near the flatline. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 50 points.
*****
> The moves come after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each closed lower for the second straight session, dipping 0.16% and 0.30%, respectively. The Dow squeezed out a gain of 38 points, or 0.09%, on Wednesday.
*****
> All three averages are down for the week, with key employment reports looming. On Thursday morning, investors will get to sift through weekly jobless claims data, while the August nonfarm payrolls report is due out Friday.
*****
> The market has appeared to be sensitive to potential growth scares in recent weeks, including Tuesday‚Äôs sell-off on the heels of weak manufacturing data. That could put increased importance on the jobless claims data, BMO Wealth Management chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma said on ‚ÄúClosing Bell.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs more of a forward-looking indicator. As long as those stay low ‚Äî people have jobs, people remain confident in the ability to find jobs or comfortable in the jobs that they have ‚Äî we think that they will continue to spend. So as long as those numbers stay low, if we get some blips in the overall monthly jobs report that shows weakness on the edges, we‚Äôre not quite as concerned,‚Äù Ma said.
*****
> The employment data could play a key role in the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decision later this month. Ma said he still believes the U.S. economy is on track for a ‚Äúsoft landing‚Äù and that the market rally should eventually broaden out. However, he added that there is likely to be continued market turbulence in the near term.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe believe in it, we just think it‚Äôs going to be on pause for a few months because this high degree of uncertainty we have right now. There‚Äôs just too much that needs to resolved over the coming months. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just very hard for the broadening-of-the-market theme to really gather momentum,‚Äù Ma said.

1f1hou9,Morgan Stanley is cutting its position in Tesla stock. Here's why,"It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.

Morgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a ‚Äúcontinued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences‚Äù for EVs.

TSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley‚Äôs model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.

Since the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.

‚ÄúWhile we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,‚Äù they wrote.

Despite Tesla‚Äôs status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).

Earlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.

These new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.

In June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles ""heavily benefit from unfair subsidies"" and present a ""threat of economic injury"" to European EV producers.",2024-08-26 06:44:24,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f1hou9/morgan_stanley_is_cutting_its_position_in_tesla/

1eibgld,"22/yo investing for roughly three years, having regrets about my choices.","Hello stockers. I was doing some reflecting, looking at my portfolio that I have slowly been building since July / Aug of 2021. I have mostly been doing stock picking based on companies I liked, and unfortunately I have come to the realization that I have missed out on quite a bit of gains from not simply investing in VOO or SPY. My total return on three years of investing is 25% (although last week it peaked at 39%, which probably goes to show that I am over exposed), but had I just put my money in VOO in a dollar cost averaging method, I would likely have a much higher return.

Any advice for me? Should I just sell things off and put them in VOO? My current portfolio breakdown looks like this. Of course some bigger losers I have sold off. *$7934 invested, $9950 current.*

1ehnm3r,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1e9p3r6,Berkshire Hathaway cuts stake in China's BYD to below 5%,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab reduced its stake in BYD (002594.SZ), opens new tab to below 5%, in what could be the final time Berkshire discloses stock sales in China's largest producer of electric vehicles.
Berkshire lowered its stake in BYD's issued H-shares to 4.94% from 5.06% on July 16, according to a Monday filing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The stake had been 7.02% as recently as June 11.
Hong Kong requires larger shareholders to disclose, opens new tab sales when their resulting stakes fall below whole percentage numbers. Disclosures can stop once ownership stakes fall below 5%.
Berkshire began investing in Shenzhen-based BYD in 2008 when it paid $230 million for about 225 million shares, then equal to a 10% stake.
It began selling BYD shares in August 2022, after the stock price had risen more than 20-fold, and two months after it set a record high.
Charlie Munger, Berkshire's late vice chairman, was the impetus behind the original BYD investment. Berkshire invests mainly in the United States.
BYD was founded by Chinese chemist Wang Chuanfu in 1995 as a maker of rechargeable batteries.
It surpassed billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab last year as the world's largest electric vehicle maker, though Tesla has since regained the top spot. In the second quarter, BYD sold 426,039 electric vehicles while Tesla sold 443,956.

1e3uol0,Is PSNY good now?,"I think PSNY is a good buy.

Here is some knowledge for all of the regards who have no idea who PSNY is good luck boy

So PSNY better known as POLESTAR is the EV baby of VOLVO. They got spun off and was basically released from them in early 2024 since Volvo said they were positioned for growth. Okay enough with the fucking history lesson‚Ä¶

The stock has been floating at around $1 USD after being around the $0.70 mark at the end of last month. So they are seeing some positive movement already in the last couple of weeks. This is just due to it being undervalued overall and a correction from what I can tell. 

As of last week they finally broke above there SMA50 and are showing some signs of a recovery. This is good news for a longer look as they should be able to hold at this $1 mark and not need to deal with delisting.

They are expanding into new market and their finances are finally in order. Previously they had some problems with delivering EPS etc but they are now closing the gap on their burn rate and looking towards positivity. 

The company while not selling a large volume of cars is under valued for the number of cars they sell at the current price point. TSLAs price per car is great than a 5X value while PSNY is less than 1/2X that. Okay I know TSLA is awesome so that‚Äôs why the price per expect sales is so high‚Ä¶ well LCID is at 2 1/2X and they haven‚Äôt been doing so hot so once again this company is undervalued for what they are performing.

We saw the markets sell off yesterday due to the CPI news, think we‚Äôre going to have a relatively flat day today. Trying to post earlier, if this post gets more traction I'll try to post earlier, otherwise will revert to the regularly scheduled post times.



[TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - We saw TSLA delay their Robotaxi Event from August to October, watching for some form of bounce in the stock. Currently long, but will remain agile (as usual) if we selloff at the open.



[NVDA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) - We also saw this turn more strongly than the other Mag7 stocks because of the close to 15% move we saw it make in the past week. No opinion on this yet, but watching for a setup.



[T](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=T&p=d) - Announces massive hack of customer data, includes records of customer calls/texts.



[SNOW](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - AT&T ($T) had their customer data illegaly downloaded from a workspace on a third-party cloud platform (identified as SNOW‚Äôs). Might be user error/social engineering (not sure) rather than a cybersecurity issue, so we might see a reversal of this move at the open. However, it should noted that there were no multifactor authentication safeguards in place in previous hacks of SNOW.



[JPM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JPM&p=d) - Reports $4.40 vs $4.19 expected EPS. NI at $18B was up 25% from the same period a year ago due to exchange of shares in Visa that provided $8B in gains.

1e0rc68,Tesla Fantasies and Industry Corruption?,"I was trying to figure out the reasons for the TSLA runup.  Saw many talking/writing about short squeeze, so-called analysts like Ives talking about robotaxi, others talking about energy, etc.   It's all over the place.  All trying to justify the crazy multiple expansion of this stock.  Most are convinced Tesla will achieve L3/L4/L5 autonomous classification to support robotaxi, as it has been sold to us.

ALL of them, I say again, ALL of them ignoring the fact that Tesla cars cannot achieve Level3 certification WITHOUT a backup system, such as LIDAR. Therefore, Tesla will never get L3 certified unless the US state motor vehicle regulators change the laws around this, and I highly doubt it will happen anytime soon. Equally I don't expect Tesla to start adding LIDAR since it would cut into their profit margin.  Assuming that by some miracle they actually achieve L3, L4/L5 is a huge leap forward and required for robotaxi.

I genuinely believe there is corruption that persist here.

1e0ds09,"RIVN, What are your thoughts?","I've been paying attention to Rivian (RIVN) and I'm holding for the long term. Historical performance has been poor, they IPO'd way over valued to raise funds, but what they're doing is expensive. It's no news that they're hemorrhaging money, citing a loss of $40,000 per vehicle sold (down from $67,000 last year). But in the last 3 months they've had some very promising announcements.

During the recent investor day webinar they talked about how Gen 1 was all about proof of concept, but now they're moving onto Gen 2 which is about manufacturing efficiency. They detailed how they reduced components, steps and fasteners to decrease production and assembly costs. It all sounds very good. In addition they just entered a deal with VW for $5 Billion and all Rivian is supplying to VW is software. It's a stepped plan, $1B up front and additional investments based on performance.

If they reduce manufacturing costs as they predict, and lower sale price as they promised, I'm thinking this stock could be ripe for big growth. They're the only company competing directly with Tesla, and on the consumer side, it's going well. I doubt we'll ever see a RIVN selling at comparable prices to TSLA, but I could see them over $100 in a few years if they continue to make advancements.

1dye0im,How to surpass the fear of selling?,"Long story short: I have some unrealised gains on stocks that I bought time ago (AMAT and ASML).

I was multiple times on the verge of selling (totally or partially) to realise gains that I could invest in another opportunity with better potential. However, every time one of these opportunities came up, I ended up always retracting and not doing so, because I didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúgive-up‚Äù to the long-term perspective I committed when I started in this.

Sadly, with opportunities I mean Meta falling like crazy 1.5 years ago for the overreaction to the decrease in user registrations, Nvidia at 200 (before split), or Netflix also dropping to 180 in mid-2022. Recently, I was about to do the same to buy a chunk of TSLA. But fear always gets me.

I know, everything is about risk tolerance. Maybe I am not made for this, who knows. However, I would be happy to know your opinion about this. I really want to take the chance if I believe that is the right choice. Any state of mind that helps you clicking in the sell button? I‚Äôm just tired of missing opportunities just for being afraid.

1dtlvh3,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ","Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla‚Äôs numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories ‚Äî Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles ‚Äî but doesn‚Äôt report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla‚Äôs current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, ‚Äúprimarily due to lower average selling price.‚Äù

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla‚Äôs factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla‚Äôs aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs ‚Äúantics‚Äù and ‚Äúpolitical rants.‚Äù

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.

In China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.

Colin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees ‚Äúdeclining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.‚Äù He recommends selling Tesla shares.

Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the ‚Äúlikelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes‚Äù as the year continues.

Investor focus will now shift to Tesla‚Äôs second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or ‚ÄúCyberCab.‚Äù

Everything below this line was written before the release of P&D numbers \~

&#x200B;

TSLA is going to release its 2024Q2 P&D numbers in the next couple of hours, WS analysts think that total delivery could reach 438,019 (vs 466,140, i.e. around 6% YoY drop).

In my opinion, 438K is still far too high based on continuous checking shared by a lot of non-WS analysts - which is supported by the data regularly released in Mainland China, Europe and the United States. The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K, implying at least 9% YoY decline.

Recall in January 2024's investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided (very tricky to be honest), does it mean ""low growth"" or actually ""no growth""?

More information will be followed post the release of 2024Q2 numbers ...

*Tesla's June-quarter deliveries likely fell 6%, the first time the top EV maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.*

*The company is expected to deliver 438,019 vehicles for the April to June period, according to an average estimate based on forecasts from 12 analysts polled by LSEG, seven of whom slashed their expectations in the past three months. The EV maker is expected to announce the results on Tuesday.*

*Tesla has hit a speed bump after years of rapid growth that helped make it the world's most valuable automaker. It warned in January that deliveries growth in 2024 would be ""notably lower"" as a boost from months-long price cuts wanes.*

1dsvu8u,"Tesla's Q2 deliveries expected to fall, but could the key figure be energy storage?","Tesla ( TSLA ) announced global vehicle deliveries for the second quarter on Tuesday, with total deliveries expected to fall short of current expectations. However, with demand for electric vehicles slowing in 2024 and the artificial intelligence boom dominating the market, perhaps Tesla's second-quarter energy storage numbers should also be cause for concern. The company deployed a record 4,053 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy storage capacity in the first quarter. Tesla now offers solar panels and solar rooftops, as well as power walls for energy storage. On the commercial side, Tesla also offers a ""Super Battery Pack.""

1dppvgp,Mastering Long-Term Investments: Combining Technical and Fundamental Analysis,"By Technical or fundamental analysis: which one is better for long-term investing? Myriad investors use one or the other technique on its own seemingly successfully, but using only one presents significant limitations.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Using a combination of both could be the ultimate winning strategy. Although the topic of technical analysis is controversial among a certain group of Wall Street investors, recent data points toward its importance when investing for the future.¬†

A study from March 2023 by Fidelity Investments‚Äô Vice President of Advanced Analytics and Insights Jasleen Kaur and a professor at the School of Business Studies in India Khushdeep Dharni looked at two different strategies of investing using advanced mathematics and computer software to mine the data necessary for more profitable trading.¬†

Computer algorithms examined both technical indicators and fundamental data across over 381 companies, showing that data-mining techniques incorporating elements of both technical and fundamental analysis led to better investment returns than a pure buy-and-hold strategy.¬†

Sifting through a huge pile of data seems much easier with the rise of faster technology, but the core principles behind the platforms with automated tools have been around for a long time and could still be used by a qualified person to reach the same results.

https://preview.redd.it/m7i4i1d7w39d1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cec9baea1fc05d2a3d391395bc0981ac8dd7987a

Conducting fundamental analysis is crucial when evaluating stocks. One should have a comprehensive understanding of a company‚Äôs financial health and performance. The kind of stock to keep for the next 10 or 20 years is the second important component ‚Äî will the company or commodity exist in the future, or is it a dying business that‚Äôll be outlawed eventually? Fundamental analysis is used in finance to evaluate the intrinsic value or real worth of a security as well as entire sectors and markets.

There‚Äôs widespread agreement that assessing investments through fundamental analysis is necessary for long term investing. Although important, on its own it could prove to be limiting. For example, if one evaluates the stock and does not look at the current chart and volume movement, one could buy an overpriced stock right before the price is set to crash.

The second step, which is also of significance, involves conducting technical analysis. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on the intrinsic value of an asset, the technical analysis examines the volume and price of shares over time. If used in isolation, one could buy a stock of a company that is about to go under and lose all the investment. Meanwhile, the data shows that technical analysis is just as important.

While the United States and India have very different markets, markets around the world are similar in terms of behavioral psychology and the research findings are true for investors around the globe in many ways.

Overall, it‚Äôs as hard to predict where the market will turn next as it is to predict the future. Whether one is seeking to improve their lifestyle or prepare for retirement, the data is important to consider. Investing is risky. The more confluence one could find pointing toward a similar direction, the better.

It‚Äôs important to use both techniques in investing and not to be susceptible to impulse investing or simply trusting someone‚Äôs piece of advice. Diligent research is paramount ‚Äî looking for and evaluating the newest research is crucial.",2024-06-27 12:16:42,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1dppvgp/mastering_longterm_investments_combining/
1dofpfu,At what point do you cut your losses?,"I‚Äôm new to investing. Been doing it about two months and overall have better returns than just leaving the money in a high yield savings account.

One of the first trades I did was buying TSLA at about 170. It ended up dropping to 165 or so and I sold to prevent losses. It dropped to the 140s but obviously now it is in the 180s. I accepted a loss when holding for not even that much longer would have made decent profit.

After I learned a lesson about patience there, I‚Äôve been trying to hold, but a few choices I‚Äôve made don‚Äôt show signs of rebounding (SEDG is down 20% today and has been decreasing pretty steadily since I bought in).

I‚Äôm still undecided if I‚Äôd like to cut my losses and try to invest in something that will give more returns in the meantime, or if I hope that the solar sector has a strong rebound in the (very) long term and just continue to hold.

For the week of June 17-23, Tesla's insurance registrations in China totaled 17,400 vehicles, up 49 percent from 11,700 in the previous week. According to local reports, vehicle registrations in China tend to be slow at the beginning of the month and pick up at the end.



With just one week left in the second quarter, Tesla China insurance registrations are up about 14 percent from the seasonally slower first quarter, but down about 7 percent from the same period in 2023.



Tesla's May deliveries in China were 72,573 units, down 6.6 percent from a year ago and up 16.7 percent from April. The U.S. electric car company sold 55,215 vehicles in China in May, up 30 percent from May 2023, according to data released by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

I have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.

1d4w5ni,Top proxy advisor ISS recommends against Elon Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay package ,"Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker‚Äôs board.

Tesla‚Äôs shareholder meeting is on June 13.

The report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk‚Äôs pay package. Tesla‚Äôs board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk‚Äôs pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.

ISS said ‚Äúcautionary‚Äù shareholder support was merited for Tesla‚Äôs plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla‚Äôs board decided to reincorporate and over the ‚Äúunknown‚Äù nature of Texas‚Äôs business law framework.

The proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla‚Äôs board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.

‚ÄúAt a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,‚Äù ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.

Pay package push

Tesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla‚Äôs Gigafactory facility in Austin.

Tesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk‚Äôs payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk‚Äôs stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.

‚ÄúOver the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,‚Äù Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.

Tesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon‚Äôs pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.

Proxy advisor pull

ISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.

They‚Äôve also been the direct target of Musk‚Äôs ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they ‚Äúeffectively control the stock market‚Äù on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called ‚Äúpassive‚Äù or institutional shareholders.

Institutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.

ISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it ‚Äúremains excessive,‚Äù noting that ‚Äúthe board has effectively only offered shareholders an ‚Äòall or nothing‚Äô option in this vote.‚Äù

The proxy advisor alluded to Musk‚Äôs myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.

Or ""I knew <insert Mag 7 stock> was a screaming buy at $x and bought some there.""

Fact is, if you have a 401k that invests in an S&P index fund, or if you DCA into VOO or whatever other S&P fund you're into, then Mag 7 is already your primary holding. And I would guess one or both of those scenarios cover 95% of the people who post here.

Look at VOO. 28% is Mag 7 (or 6, since TSLA isn't in the top 10) : [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/voo/holdings](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/voo/holdings)

""I own Mag 7"" comments sound as bizarre as ""I breathe air"" or ""I drink water"". We all do. Nothing special about it. The exception is if you own a ridiculous amount, like people who have $1M+ of NVDA now that they first started buying in 2011. Also, if anyone feels bad they didn't buy META at $100 or NVDA at the end of 2023, they shouldn't because they actually did buy there if they were actively contributing to their 401k or Roth.",2024-05-24 00:10:37,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cz7qqd/why_do_people_feel_the_need_to_disclose_they_hold/
1cz17nk,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: ‚ÄúTesla is far ahead in self-driving cars‚Äù,"‚ÄúNvidia (NVDA) Chief Executive Jensen Huang talked up Tesla (TSLA) autonomous driving efforts on Wednesday, claiming the EV giant is ""far ahead"" on self-driving vehicles and that all cars will eventually have autonomous abilities. It also just so happens that Tesla‚Äôs FSD is powered by Nvdia‚Äôs chips. TSLA shares angled lower Thursday.

""Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars but every single car someday will have to have autonomous capability,"" Huang told Yahoo Finance Wednesday night. 

""One of the things that's really revolutionary about version 12 of Tesla's full self-driving is that it's an end-to-end generative model,"" Huang added. ""It learns from watching videos ‚Äî surround video ‚Äî and it learns about how to drive end-to-end, and using generative AI, predict the path and how to understand and how to steer the car.

BYD (HKG: 1211, OTCMKTS: BYDDY) continued to dominate China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market in April, with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) dropping in its ranking.

BYD's retail sales of passenger NEVs in China totaled 254,131 units in April, giving it the No. 1 spot in the NEV market with a 37.5 percent share, according to a ranking released today by the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA).

The NEV maker was the only one with a share of more than 30 percent, with retail sales up 31.1 percent year-on-year.

BYD released figures earlier this month showing it sold 313,245 NEVs in April, up 48.96 percent from a year earlier and up 3.57 percent from March. The figures are wholesale sales and include both passenger cars and commercial vehicles.

China's passenger NEVs sold 674,000 units at retail in April, up 28.3 percent from a year ago but down 5.7 percent from March, CPCA data released yesterday showed.

Tesla's retail sales in China in April were 31,421 units, down 21.4 percent from a year ago, and ranked No. 5 with a 4.6 percent share.

In the CPCA's March retail sales rankings of NEVs released last month, Tesla was No. 2 with an 8.8 percent share, behind BYD's 36.6 percent.

It's worth noting that in China, NEVs include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel-cell vehicles. BYD produces PHEVs and BEVs, while Tesla only produces BEVs.

Tesla sold 62,167 China-made vehicles in April, including 30,746 exported, according to CPCA data released yesterday.

Tesla has a factory in Shanghai that produces the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, both for deliveries to local customers and as an export hub for it.

Tesla's pattern is to produce cars for export in the first half of the quarter and for the local market in the second half, it previously said.

Geely's retail sales of NEVs in April were up 76.3 percent at 49,155 units, placing it at No. 2 with a 7.3 percent share.

Changan Automobile's NEV retail sales in April were up 119 percent to 40,507 units, placing it 3rd with a 6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD's NEV retail sales were 840,137 units, up 19.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 1 with a 34.3 percent share.

FAW-Volkswagen sold 119,032 units at retail in April, down 15.6 percent year-on-year, and ranked No. 2 with a 7.8 percent share.

Geely had retail sales of 115,723 units in April, up 31.2 percent year-on-year, to take 3rd place with a 7.6 percent share.

In the January-April period, BYD was No. 1 in China's passenger car market with a 13.2 percent share, FAW-Volkswagen was No. 2 with an 8.1 percent share and Geely was No. 3 with a 7.9 percent share.

1covdpg,"Elon Musk backtracks on Supercharger network halt, says more chargers coming","Last week Tesla's CEO fired nearly the entire 500-member Supercharger team. Tesla's partners are demanding answers, with competitors waiting in the wings.

Leave it to Tesla CEO Elon Musk to add more chaos to a situation that he ostensibly created in the first place.

In a tweet on X early Friday morning, Musk addressed concerns many have had over his recent move to shrink down Tesla‚Äôs (TSLA) Supercharger team.

‚ÄúJust to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year,‚Äù Musk wrote. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher.‚Äù

Shortly thereafter, Musk also started a ‚ÄúSupercharger Community‚Äù on X, where members can discuss and share stories on the topic.

Whether Musk‚Äôs proclamation that Tesla is still heavily investing in the Supercharger is accurate or not is another story, but the industry, investors, and EV owners are seeking clarity and demanding answers.

Last week Musk and Tesla laid off nearly the entire Supercharger organization, which was responsible for the build-out of its best-in-class charging network. In the aftermath of the initial layoffs, Musk addressed the Supercharger news on X, stating that the network will grow at ‚Äúa slower pace‚Äù for new locations.

Automakers like GM, Ford, Kia, Polestar, Stellantis, Honda, and others had signed up to access the Supercharger network, and incorporate Tesla‚Äôs NACS plug inlet in their future vehicles, under the promise that the Supercharger network would continue to grow at a steady pace.

Tesla was likely getting an earful from its NACS partners, questioning what they were getting exactly after signing deals to access the Supercharger network.

In addition, contractors and others working with Tesla on existing Supercharger projects were getting their emails bounced back with no feedback on what to do next. Tesla also apparently backed out of leases at four upcoming Supercharger sites in New York, per EV blog Electrek.

Charging network provider EVgo told Yahoo Finance that it was ‚Äúactively engaged‚Äù in the development of the NACS network and was adding more locations to take advantage of Tesla‚Äôs move to backtrack its expansion.

EVgo competitor Blink Charging is also poised to move on the opportunity, claiming potential Supercharger customers contacted Blink about future orders in the wake of Tesla‚Äôs move.

Even oil and gas stalwarts like BP are moving in on Tesla. With its BP Pulse charging network, the company said it ‚Äúis aggressively looking to acquire real estate to scale our network, which is a heightened focus following the recent Tesla announcement.‚Äù

The company‚Äôs top executive is even telling Tesla‚Äôs jilted partners to give him a ring.

‚ÄúIf there are stranded real estate partners who are looking for someone to call, they should feel free to pick up the phone and call me or look me up on LinkedIn,‚Äù BP Pulse Americas CEO Sujay Sharma told Bloomberg.

**US seeks answers from Tesla in Autopilot recall probe**

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07)

&#x200B;

*U.S. auto safety investigators are seeking detailed answers and documents from Tesla in a probe into the automaker's December recall of more than 2 million vehicles to install new Autopilot safeguards.*

*The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last month it was investigating after receiving reports of 20 crashes involving vehicles that had the Autopilot software updates installed under Tesla's recall. The agency's letter said it had identified ""several concerns"", regarding the recall.*

*Tesla said in December its largest-ever recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles - or nearly all of its vehicles on U.S. roads - was to better ensure drivers pay attention when using its advanced driver assistance system.*

*The NHTSA recall investigation covers models Y, X, S, 3 and Cybertruck vehicles in the U.S. equipped with Autopilot produced between the 2012 and 2024 model years.*

*Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said repeatedly that Autopilot does not make vehicles self-driving and is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who is prepared to take over and has hands on the steering wheel.*

*NHTSA said it had sent Tesla an information request letter, which was made public on Tuesday, seeking details of the recall and documents by July 1.*

*NHTSA wants comparative data from Tesla on the performance of vehicles after receiving the recall including the number of hands on wheel warnings issued.*

*The agency said it had concerns after those 20 crashes as well as results from preliminary NHTSA tests of updated vehicles following Tesla's five-part recall remedy.*

*One issue under investigation is Tesla's recall allows drivers to set how they activate Autopilot by either allowing a single-pull or double-pull of the drive stalk.*

*NHTSA's letter said the single-pull activation of Autopilot ""is not the default setting on vehicles that received the remedy in the field"" and testing ""showed it was possible to make this change while driving.""*

*Tesla has also made additional updates to reduce crashes including high speed captive turn lane collisions that are not part of the recall.*

*NHTSA said it ""will assess the timing and driving factors behind these updates, their impacts on subject vehicle field performance, and Tesla‚Äôs basis for not including them"".*

*Last month, NHTSA said it found evidence that ""Tesla‚Äôs weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot‚Äôs permissive operating capabilities"" and that this results in a ""critical safety gap.""*

*NHTSA said during its Autopilot safety probe launched in August 2021 that it had identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving at least one death and many more involving serious injuries in which ""foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.""*

*NHTSA noted Tesla's December recall ""allows a driver to readily reverse"" the software update.*

**Elon Musk proposed to launch robotaxis in China during April visit, state media report says**

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-may-support-teslas-domestic-testing-demonstration-robotaxis-says-media-2024-05-08](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-may-support-teslas-domestic-testing-demonstration-robotaxis-says-media-2024-05-08)

&#x200B;

*Elon Musk proposed testing Tesla's advanced driver-assistance package in China by deploying it in robotaxis, during his recent visit to the country, the state-backed China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.*

*Chinese officials told the Tesla CEO that China ""welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country"" and hopes it can ""set a good example"", the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.*

*However, Chinese authorities did not immediately approve its widespread use of Full Self-Driving (FSD) functions, the newspaper added.*

*Before the full rollout of its FSD functions, Tesla still needs to get approval to collect and transfer data that Tesla's cars need to train its driver-assistance features. The newspaper added that this issue wasn't discussed in detail during Musk's visit.*

*A person briefed on the matter told Reuters that Tesla is seeking to apply to launch the robotaxi tests in Shanghai, where the company's largest factory globally is located.*

*Tesla and the Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*The China Daily report comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a whirlwind weekend trip to Beijing late last month, where he met Chinese Premier Li Qiang.*

*Musk on the trip intended to discuss the rollout of FSD and whether Tesla could secure government approvals to transfer data overseas that could prove pivotal in its development of autonomous vehicles, Reuters previously reported.*

*FSD is the most autonomous version of Autopilot software and was rolled out in 2020. Its features include self-parking, auto lane changes and traffic navigation.*

*Among the wins during Musk's trip, which was first reported by Reuters, was a key endorsement from a top Chinese auto association that said Tesla's Model 3 and Y cars were compliant with data-security regulations. That would enable local governments to allow Tesla cars into parts of China they were previously barred from, Chinese media reported, citing a statement from Tesla.*

*Tesla has also reached an agreement with Baidu to use the Chinese tech giant's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads, according to two people who at the time described that as a step toward FSD rollout in China.*

*The China Daily newspaper, however, citing a source close to Baidu, said that the deal only meant that the accuracy of Baidu's maps provided to Tesla would be improved and that it had no direct relation with FSD.*

*Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*Musk has abandoned a longstanding goal for Tesla to make affordable electric cars for the masses and is looking to focus on autonomous driving software, robotaxis and its humanoid robot Optimus.*

*Last month, the company mentioned a ""purpose-built robotaxi product"" that it planned to build with a ""revolutionary"" manufacturing process, without offering a timeline for its release.*

*China has been at the forefront in the development of self-driving cars, and companies such as Baidu and Toyota-backed Pony.ai have launched robotaxi services in limited test zones in several cities.*

&#x200B;

*U.S. prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles‚Äô self-driving capabilities, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.*

*Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems assist with steering, braking and lane changes - but are not fully autonomous. While Tesla has warned drivers to stay ready to take over driving, the Justice Department is examining other statements by Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk suggesting its cars can drive themselves.*

*U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes, including fatal ones, that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged, resulting in a mass recall by the automaker.*

*Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022, and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining.*

*Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources said.*

*The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Tesla‚Äôs representations about driver-assistance systems to investors, one of the people said. The SEC declined to comment.*

*Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Last October, it disclosed in a filing that the Justice Department had asked the company for information about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.*

*The Justice Department declined to comment.*

*The probe, which is not evidence of wrongdoing, could result in criminal charges, civil sanctions, or no action. Prosecutors are far from deciding how to proceed, one of the sources said, in part because they are sifting through voluminous documents Tesla provided in response to subpoenas.*

*Reuters could not determine the specific statements prosecutors are reviewing as potentially illegal. Musk has aggressively touted the prowess of Tesla‚Äôs driver-assistance technology for nearly a decade.*

*Tesla videos demonstrating the technology that remain archived on its website say: ‚ÄúThe person in the driver‚Äôs seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.‚Äù*

*A Tesla engineer testified in 2022 in a lawsuit over a fatal crash involving Autopilot that one of the videos, posted in October 2016, intended to show the technology‚Äôs potential and did not accurately portray its capabilities at the time. Musk nevertheless posted the video on social media, writing: ‚ÄúTesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway streets, then finds a parking spot.‚Äù*

*In a conference call with reporters in 2016, Musk described Autopilot as ‚Äúprobably better‚Äù than a human driver. During an October 2022 call, Musk addressed a forthcoming FSD upgrade he said would allow customers to travel ‚Äúto your work, your friend‚Äôs house, to the grocery store without you touching the wheel.‚Äù*

*Musk is increasingly focused on self-driving technology as Tesla's car sales and profit slump. Tesla recently slashed costs through mass layoffs and shelved plans for a long-awaited $25,000 model that had been expected to drive sales growth.*

*‚ÄúGoing balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move,‚Äù the billionaire executive posted on his social-media platform X in mid-April. Tesla shares, down more than 28% so far this year, surged in late April when Musk visited China and made progress toward approvals to sell FSD there.*

*Musk has repeatedly promised self-driving Teslas for about a decade. ""Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,"" Tesla lawyers said in a 2022 court filing.*

*LEGAL CHALLENGES*

*Prosecutors scrutinizing Tesla‚Äôs autonomous-car claims are proceeding with caution, recognizing the legal hurdles they face, the people familiar with the inquiry said.*

*They will need to demonstrate that Tesla‚Äôs claims crossed a line from legal salesmanship to material and knowingly false statements that unlawfully harmed consumers or investors, three legal experts uninvolved in the probe told Reuters.*

*U.S. courts previously have ruled that ‚Äúpuffery‚Äù or ‚Äúcorporate optimism‚Äù regarding product claims do not amount to fraud. In 2008, a federal appeals court ruled that statements of corporate optimism alone do not demonstrate that a company official intentionally misled investors.*

*Justice Department officials will likely seek internal Tesla communications as evidence that Musk or others knew they were making false statements, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. That is a challenge, Richman said, but the safety risk involved in overselling self-driving systems also ‚Äúspeaks to the seriousness with which prosecutors, a judge and jury would take the statements.‚Äù*

*FATAL CRASHES*

*Tesla‚Äôs claims about Autopilot and FSD have also drawn scrutiny in regulatory investigations and lawsuits.*

*Safety regulators and courts have raised concerns in recent months that corporate messaging about the technology - including the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving - have imbued customers with a false sense of security.*

*In April, the Washington State Patrol arrested a man on suspicion of vehicular homicide after his Tesla, with Autopilot engaged, struck and killed a motorcyclist while the driver looked at his phone, police records show. In a probable-cause statement, a trooper cited the driver‚Äôs ‚Äúadmitted inattention to driving, while on autopilot mode ... putting trust in the machine to drive for him.‚Äù*

*In Washington state, a driver remains ""responsible for the safe and legal operation of that vehicle"" regardless of its technological capabilities, a state patrol spokesperson told Reuters.*

*The same month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into whether a Tesla recall of more than 2 million vehicles in December adequately addressed safety issues with Autopilot.*

*NHTSA declined to comment.*

*The recall followed a long-running probe opened by regulators after cars with Autopilot engaged repeatedly crashed into vehicles at first-responder emergency scenes. Regulators subsequently examined hundreds of crashes where Autopilot was engaged and identified 14 deaths and 54 injuries.*

*Tesla disputed NHTSA's findings but agreed to the recall, which employed over-the-air software updates intended to alert inattentive drivers.*

*The NHTSA investigation found ‚Äúa critical safety gap between drivers‚Äô expectations‚Äù of Tesla‚Äôs technology ‚Äúand the system‚Äôs true capabilities,‚Äù according to agency records. ‚ÄúThis gap led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes.‚Äù*",2024-05-08 09:11:41,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cn05bd/tsla_robotaxi_in_mainland_china_instead_of_the/

1cfwypc,Tesla jumps 10% in premarket trade after passing key hurdle to roll out full self-driving in China,"Shares of Tesla rose sharply in U.S. premarket trading on Monday after the electric car maker passes a significant milestone to roll out its full self-driving technology in China.

The company‚Äôs share price spiked more than 10% just after 7:30 a.m. ET, as investors reacted to news surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs visit to China.

Tesla on Sunday said that local Chinese authorities removed restrictions on its cars after passing the country‚Äôs data security requirements.

The move raised expectations that Tesla‚Äôs driver-assistance software Full Self Driving (FSD) would soon be available in the country, which is the largest market for electric vehicles.

While Tesla‚Äôs electric cars are some of the most popular vehicles in China, they have reportedly been banned from some government-related properties due to data security concerns.

Separately, the Biden administration earlier this year announced a probe into whether imported cars from China pose national security risks due to their ability to potentially collect sensitive data.

FSD is an upgrade to Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot driver assistant. Tesla has offered its FSD technology in China for years, but with a restricted feature set that limits it to operations, such as automated lane changing.

Data security concerns have been a key obstacle preventing Tesla from achieving a full rollout of the system in China.

Tesla also reportedly scored a deal with Baidu that would give Musk‚Äôs firm access to the Chinese internet giant‚Äôs mapping and navigation technology for Tesla‚Äôs FSD feature.

The agreement would allow Tesla to tap into Baidu‚Äôs mapping service license, which is a requirement for intelligence driving systems to operate on public roads in China, Reuters reported, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

CNBC was unable to independently verify the report. Tesla and Baidu were not immediately available for comment.

With the license, which foreign companies can only clinch in partnership with local Chinese firms, Tesla will be allowed to legally operate FSD on Chinese roads, and its fleets will be able to gather data about traffic, road signs and routes.

The breakthrough for Tesla toward bringing its FSD self-driving technology to China marks a key win for the firm at a time when it is facing hefty competition in the Chinese market. Local rivals such as Warren Buffett-backed electric vehicle maker BYD, Nio, and Xpeng have ramped up their competition with Tesla in recent years.

BYD was temporarily the largest electric vehicle maker globally, producing more than 3 million new energy vehicles in 2023. The firm recently lost its crown as world‚Äôs largest EV maker, after a 43% plunge in sales in the first quarter.

1jrqzht,Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era,"Elon Musk‚Äôs ventures have long dominated ‚Äúspace investing‚Äù conversations ‚Äì but with Musk‚Äôs recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn‚Äôt publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10‚Äì11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn‚Äôt: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let‚Äôs break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab‚Äôs financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They‚Äôve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab‚Äôs next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer ‚Äì Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn‚Äôt waiting around: they‚Äôve signed new launch deals (e.g. an 8-launch contract with Japan‚Äôs iQPS just announced) , and they delivered on missions like launching 8 satellites for OroraTech with just 4 months‚Äô turnaround , showcasing operational excellence.
* Government and Commercial Tailwinds: Unlike many space SPACs and startups that struggled, Rocket Lab has real customers and repeat business. Their backlog is \~$1.1B , split \~50/50 between government and commercial clients ‚Äì providing diversification. Notably, Rocket Lab was selected for the U.S. Space Force‚Äôs NSSL Phase 3 (Lane 1) program , making them eligible for missions under a $5.6B launch contract umbrella alongside incumbents like SpaceX and ULA. They also hold a $515M contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to build missile-tracking satellite systems . These wins not only validate Rocket Lab‚Äôs technology in the eyes of key customers, but also ensure a baseline of revenue in coming years. In essence, Rocket Lab is aligning itself as a core player in future government space infrastructure ‚Äì a recurring revenue stream that many ‚Äúnew space‚Äù companies lack.
* Musk Factor ‚Äì or Lack Thereof: From an investing standpoint, one could argue that Musk has become a risk factor. Tesla‚Äôs own 10-K warned that the brand is tied to Musk‚Äôs reputation , and indeed we‚Äôve seen political backlash contribute to Tesla‚Äôs sales slump and stock drop . SpaceX, while successful, is privately funded and also influenced by Musk‚Äôs persona (which might carry regulatory or public image risks, given his role in government and polarizing public statements). Rocket Lab provides a ‚ÄúMusk-free‚Äù exposure to the space sector. CEO Peter Beck is an engineer-executive who keeps a lower profile. There‚Äôs no cult of personality driving Rocket Lab‚Äôs valuation ‚Äì which means less idiosyncratic risk. In fact, Rocket Lab‚Äôs shares are more directly correlated with its execution (launch success, contracts, revenue) than with any social media narrative. For an investor, that can be reassuring.

Valuation Considerations: After the recent pullback, RKLB trades at a more reasonable multiple relative to its growth. It had skyrocketed over 400% in the past year , but is now off highs. Analysts still see upside: Cantor Fitzgerald recently reaffirmed an Overweight with a $24 target , and other targets range up to $33 . Clearly, expectations are that Rocket Lab will continue to scale and eventually approach profitability as Neutron comes into service. Risks include execution delays (a short-seller argued Neutron could be late to 2026 , which would slow revenue growth) and competition (SpaceX‚Äôs dominance, emerging players like Blue Origin). However, Rocket Lab‚Äôs head start in small launch and established customer base give it a moat in its niche. Its enterprise value ($11B) is a fraction of SpaceX‚Äôs ($140B private valuation), so investors are essentially betting that Rocket Lab can capture even a small slice of SpaceX‚Äôs market share in the coming years ‚Äì which would justify significant upside.

Conclusion: If you‚Äôre disillusioned with Musk or simply want a piece of the space sector‚Äôs growth, Rocket Lab is one of the most compelling options available. It combines the innovation of New Space with the accountability of a public company. As always, invest based on your due diligence (space is a risky industry), but RKLB offers a balanced risk-reward profile: solid current business, big future bets, and freedom from the Elon factor. For many, that‚Äôs an attractive proposition in 2025 and beyond.

1jrj6vf,Tariffs & Tesla- Will the hit affect sentiment around Tesla? And are you a goldfish?,"I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, just move on. 

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain. 

Here is a great interview with the well respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those with short attention spans, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".
2. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends. 
3. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*  
4. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.
5. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession. 
6. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us). 
7. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices. 
8. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.
9. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).
10. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business has very long time cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.
11. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.
12. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. 
13. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view. 

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administrations haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

\*I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out, as far more likely to be of great benefit China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR)

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from it's recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen an *real* damage to it's share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon! 

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. He is going to build a car in 5-seconds. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. Fact: It is physically impossible to build an entire car in 5-seconds because of physics (Newton's Second Law applies here: F=ma). It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised voters that he would do. He will have to pick between his voters and Elon soon enough. 

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.   

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the most rosy picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself). But if there is real lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers, Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future, boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.  

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow. 

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost- and counting. While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a bandaid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time. 

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla. 

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

By¬†Marco Chown Oved from the Star

""Canada has frozen $43 million in payments to Tesla pending a line-by-line investigation into its last-minute surge in EV rebate claims made on the final weekend of the government program.

The American EV maker run by U.S. presidential adviser Elon Musk will also be excluded from all future EV rebate programs as long as tariffs are in place, former transport minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement.

The stop-payment order appears to have been made before the current election was called Sunday, though Freeland only confirmed it Tuesday, while on the campaign trail for her University‚ÄîRosedale seat.

‚ÄúAs soon as I became Transport Minister, I asked the department to stop all payments for Tesla vehicles in order to fully examine each claim individually and determine whether all are eligible and valid. No payments will be made until we are confident that the claims are valid,‚Äù she said in a statement texted to the Star.

‚ÄúI also directed my department to change the eligibility criteria for future iZEV programs to ensure that Tesla vehicles will not be eligible for incentive programs so long as the illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.‚Äù""

1jixx9v,Opening an individual brokerage account,"So I already have a 401k that is broadly diversified. It‚Äôs in US index funds, international stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. It‚Äôs gotten a lifetime rate of return just above 8.5% since its inception. I get a 100% match up to six percent and I put in a little more than that (7%). I started it when I was in my early 20s and now that I‚Äôm mid thirties it has a healthy balance albeit I‚Äôm not maxing out contributions, only slightly more than enough to get my full match.

I also take advantage of my company stock purchase plan and get a 15% match up to a certain dollar amount. I just started doing this within the past year. 

I do have an emergency fund. It could be larger but has two months of expenses saved up. 

I thought about opening up an individual brokerage account (like Robinhood or Fidelity) to start a third investment. For two reasons:

1. It allow me to access the money sooner than 59 and a half if I were to ever need/want to. So travel, home repairs, supplement possible early retirement etc. However it wouldn‚Äôt be unless I really needed to access it. 

2. I could pick stocks/index funds I really want to invest in, or avoid those I don‚Äôt want. My 401k does invest minorly in oil companies and Tesla. I prefer to avoid these if at all possible and could either pick several companies I like (Microsoft, Apple, Google, NVDA, etc.) and invest in them. Hoping tech might outperform my more diversified 401k. 

It seems my 401k already invests in broad index funds like BlackRock Russell 1000 index fund. So investing in the S&P 500 seems like it would be redundant, no?

It wouldn‚Äôt be a lot of money a month. I‚Äôd continue to add to my HYSA emergency fund more, but throw some spare money (say $50-$100 a month) at a brokerage account just to see what happens? Or am I better off just putting the money in my 401k due to the tax advantage? Currently the bulk of my 401k is in a pretax account but I have a small (and growing) portion in a Roth 401k. 

My ultimate goal is to build wealth, but I‚Äôd like flexibility as well. ",2025-03-24 18:28:23,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jixx9v/opening_an_individual_brokerage_account/

1jgkamz,TSLA Fair Value Analysis: The bull The Bear . The case for the 140 and 180 Valuation,"

TL;DR: Tesla is significantly overvalued at current levels ($240). Fair value range $140-180 based on deteriorating growth metrics, declining margins, and elevated valuation multiples. Current prices require near-perfect execution on unproven future tech bets.

---

I've been watching the Tesla story unfold for years, and recent developments demand a sober reassessment of the stock's fair value. After diving into the latest financials and operational metrics, I believe the market is significantly overestimating Tesla's near-term prospects.

Current Market Sentiment vs. Financial Reality

While Wall Street maintains an average price target around $310-340, I see a serious disconnect with Tesla's financial performance:

Stagnant Growth: 2024 revenue grew a meager 0.95% YoY, with the company posting its first-ever annual delivery decline
Margin Compression: Q4 operating margin fell to 6.2%, down from 8.2% a year earlier, as Tesla sacrifices profitability for volume
Valuation Stretch: Currently trading at 161x P/E - astronomical even for a growth company, especially one showing signs of maturation

The Cybertruck Debacle: Canary in the Coal Mine

The Cybertruck situation isn't just about recalls or insurance challenges - it exposes fundamental issues with Tesla's execution:

* Production challenges with new materials and manufacturing techniques
* Price points that severely limit market potential (originally pitched as a mass-market vehicle)
* Sales volumes falling dramatically short of projections (40K annually vs. Musk's 250K target)

Why $140-180 is Fair Value

A 40-50% downside from current levels might seem extreme, but consider:

1. Rational Multiples: A 50-75x P/E would still be generous for a company with stalled growth and margin pressure. This alone justifies significant contraction.

2. Auto Industry Fundamentals: Legacy automakers typically trade at 5-15x earnings. Even with Tesla's energy business and software potential, a 100% premium to industry leaders feels more appropriate than the current 1000%+ premium.

3. Valuation Models Agree: Discounted cash flow analyses consistently show fair value around $150, with some sophisticated models suggesting even lower targets.

## Profiting From This View

Options for bulls(No not Caesars legion)  :
* Reduce position sizes to limit exposure
* Sell covered calls to generate income while holding core positions
* Focus on defined-risk options strategies rather than outright stock ownership

For bears (No not the NCR ):
* Consider put spreads 6+ months out to avoid short-term volatility
* Focus on strike prices in the $180-200 range for optimal risk/reward

For neutral investors(Finally I escape the FNV brain rot ) :
* Wait for better entry points in the $140-180 range
* Use cash-secured puts at those levels to potentially acquire shares at even better prices

Risk Factors To My Thesis

I acknowledge several potential upside catalysts:

* The affordable model (expected H1 2025) could exceed volume expectations
* FSD/robotaxi progress could accelerate more quickly than anticipated
* Trump administration policies could benefit Tesla's competitiveness
* Energy storage business could see inflection point in growth/margins

## Bottom Line

The market is pricing Tesla as if every ambitious future project will succeed perfectly. History shows that even the most visionary companies encounter delays, setbacks, and execution challenges. A fair valuation needs to account for these risks.

At $140-180, Tesla would still command a premium valuation that respects its innovation potential while acknowledging the very real headwinds it faces in 2025-2026.

1jdd2hh,Anatomy of gas lighting investors,"Trump Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, is worth about 500 million dollars.  During his tenure at Soros Fund Management he brought in over a billion dollars betting on the collapse of the British pound  (Black Wednesday), he also made out like a bandit betting on the collapse of the Yen.

He started his own investment firm, Key Square Group.  which did so badly they lost a ton of investors until the economic boom under Biden. His firm was very profitable 2021-2023.  The S&P under Biden gave us + 58% or so return or so (corrected).

He recently said what the Trump stock market tank is just an ordinary cycle, and that had we not prospered so much in 2006, 2007 we would not have had the ""market correction"" of 2008.  2008 was caused by deregulation and bad loans (amongst other things).   He is gaslighting investors and all Americans

He stands to make a ton of money from an impending recession.

Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, is an investment banker and worth between 2-4 billion dollars. He is on record saying Trump tariffs are ""worth it"" if they cause a recession. He has also said it's Biden's fault if we have a recession.

Biden oversaw the best economy we have seen in 50 years.

What these men have in common is both are bullshitting investors and all Americans.  Egg prices could go to $500 a dozen and they would buy the same amount of eggs they do now and not feel a thing.  They will also profit during a recession and they will be in  a great position to buy anything they want at cheap prices.

No telling how many White House insiders are shorting the S&P and other funds.

It's important that investors scrutinize the economy as well as those who are implementing policies that are degrading the market and realize when you are being gaslighted by those will profit from investor ignorance.

Finally, you hear a lot of noise these days with mindless cliches: ""timing the market"" or ""panic selling"" from people who are so gas lit you should avoid smoking around them to avoid combustion.

Buffet is sitting on more cash in the history of BRK and for a reason, and he has clearly said tariffs are not paid by the tooth fairy (they are paid by you and I).

The best thing an investor can do right now is understand fundamental economics and recognize when you are being gaslighted.  What you are seeing is not a market correction nor an ordinary cycle.  You're witnessing a very healthy market get tanked, and on purpose.

The irony is the market tries to love Trump.  They love his deregulation, low taxes for the rich and corporations, the end of red tape, etc.  The market loved his election win and we were seeing fresh highs.

Until he started his trade wars and threats to invade, and annex foreign countries.

Finally, both Trump and Elon have said it's going to be ""painful"" for a ""while"".  It will not be painful for them.  They will feel nothing, Trump has made hundreds of millions in the last few months off of his various grifts, Elon has tanked Tesla with his Nazi antics, but it's not like he's having to go to fewer movies or tighten his budget.

Many stocks in the market are significantly overvalued‚ÄîTesla, Apple, Costco, Palantir, and much of the FMCG and pharmaceutical sectors, considering their sluggish growth. Even Nvidia could see its valuation tumble if China or AMD develop viable alternatives.

Market crashes don‚Äôt worry me; they‚Äôre necessary and often present great buying opportunities. What truly concerns me is the long-term effect of excess liquidity. Inflation is brewing beneath the surface, and we‚Äôll see its full impact in the years ahead. Over time, the velocity of money has declined while the money supply has surged, artificially propping up asset prices. My real fear isn‚Äôt a crash‚Äîit‚Äôs that inflation-adjusted returns will shrink to irrelevance.

Bonds are effectively useless. Stocks are outrageously priced, making it difficult to generate meaningful returns. This isn‚Äôt a market for investors‚Äîit‚Äôs a market for those looking to cash out. Genuine opportunities are scarce.

If inflation accelerates, cash will erode, bonds will remain dead weight, and overpriced stocks will have no room for growth. In the end, nobody wins. After years of zero interest rates and relentless quantitative easing, my biggest concern is that when the real downturn hits, the Fed will have little ammunition left to respond.",2025-03-15 17:55:52,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jc0xk4/the_situation_of_the_market/
1j9ygro,Remembering stock market crash of 2022,"It‚Äôs easy to forget how short the market‚Äôs memory is.

Still remember the last few months of 2022. The S&P 500 was down nearly 25%, the Nasdaq had crashed over 35%, and inflation was out of control. The Fed was hiking rates aggressively, and it felt like a deep recession was inevitable.

Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan (don't remember which) predicted the S&P 500 would go all the way to 3,000. Michael Burry suggested an even bigger collapse taking S&P500 back to 1800. Most investors were convinced this was just the beginning of more pain. Even then people talked about stagflation and going into the lost decade.

Meta, in particular, was the poster child of despair. Down 75%, from $380 to $88. People genuinely thought it would never recover. The ad market was dying. Reels weren‚Äôt making money. Zuckerberg was ""burning billions"" on the metaverse. Investors wanted him to shut it all down.

It wasn‚Äôt just Meta. Amazon reported its first unprofitable year after a long time. Google‚Äôs ad revenue shrank. Microsoft‚Äôs growth slowed. Tesla was down to $113 at its lowest. Institutions were slashing price targets left and right. Investors were selling at the lows, convinced things would only get worse.

And then... the market did what it always does. Slowly, things started improving. Companies adapted. Earnings stabilized. The panic faded. By mid-2023, inflation was cooling. The Fed hinted at pausing rate hikes.

Meta posted a solid earnings report. Then came $40 billion in stock buybacks. The stock doubled. Then doubled again. Amazon recovered. Nvidia went on a historic run. The Nasdaq had its best year in two decades in 2023. By early 2024, Meta, Nvidia, and Microsoft were hitting all-time highs to reach even higher by end of 2024. Two years of record gains.

When markets are crashing, it feels like they‚Äôll never go up again. When they‚Äôre at all-time highs, it feels like they‚Äôll never go down. Neither is true.

So investors, it's going to be fine. Just be calm and hold tight. And if you can, keep buying.",2025-03-12 23:46:22,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9ygro/remembering_stock_market_crash_of_2022/
1j9rkno,CHGG: 20% downside / 200%+ upside?,"I ran a financial analysis on Chegg (CHGG) and... I am excited! 

Fight me if you disagree with the thesis below.

In a nutshell:

\-the¬†**market cap ($80m) is currently largely below the net asset position value ($213m),**¬†while the company is cash flow positive with more than¬†**$400m+ of revenues**

\-a cost cutting plan is currently being implemented and there is a lot to cut:¬†**the company spent $170m on R&D in 2024...**

\-the management has initiated a strategic review: ""*we are undertaking a strategic review process and exploring a range of alternatives to maximize shareholder value,*¬†***including being acquired, undertaking a go-private transaction***"" (this quote is from Q4 24).

\-Market cap is so low compared to the net asset value, the stock could easily do 2-3x when the outcome is announced;¬†**Goldman Sachs has been hired**.

\-In addition, a lawsuit has been filed against Google who is previewing Chegg's content in AI-powered search (IP infringement): Chegg could get¬†**up to c. $500m in compensatory damages**¬†due to revenue loss caused by AI Overviews (estimated at c. $100-200m annual hit)

\-Yes, the topline is currently declining 20%: this is a similar growth profile to what is coming for Tesla...¬†**except that we are on less than 2x P/E and less than 1x EBITDA**, while having a positive¬†**net asset position at 3x the market cap!**

\-Finally,¬†**the stock is highly shorted**

**This is not a financial advice, just my own analysis. I really like the stock.**

\*\*\*

**Few numbers below as of 31-Dec-24:**

\-Market cap of $80m (current market cap as of today)

\-Cash: $161m

\-Short-term investments (government bonds): $154m

\-Long-term investments (government bonds): $213m

**=> total cash + government bond position: $528m**

\-Liabilities: a convertible bond: $359 + $127 = $486m

**=> Net cash position = $42m**

\-Properties: $171m

**=> Net cash position + value of properties = $213m (2.7x the market cap!!)**",2025-03-12 18:49:30,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j9rkno/chgg_20_downside_200_upside/

Tesla isn‚Äôt fundamentally broken, this is just market sentiment and negative media. It has billions in cash, can pivot into AI, energy, and robotics and long-term EV adoption is inevitable.

1j6jbvv,"Are stock valuations simply a product of investor belief in scarcity? If we treat stocks as a store of value, like Bitcoin, gold, or even Tesla, does that make traditional macroeconomic analysis less relevant?","I have been thinking about how we value stocks and why traditional macroeconomic analysis still holds water in today‚Äôs markets. Typically, stocks are evaluated using earnings, growth rates, interest rates, and other economic indicators. Yet, oftentimes prices seem driven more by narrative and investor sentiment than by fundamentals.

Tesla offers an example. At times, its stock price has soared far beyond what traditional metrics might justify. Much of its valuation appears linked to the story of its potential to revolutionize energy and transportation. Many see Tesla not simply as an auto manufacturer but as an innovation pioneer. Its market value then reflects the belief that investing in Tesla secures a piece of a scarce, transformative opportunity.

Consider Bitcoin. Its appeal stems largely from its fixed supply. Investors treat it as digital gold, a scarce asset that preserves value even though it does not generate revenue. Similarly, gold is prized not for income but for its long history as a reliable store of value, especially in uncertain times.

This leads me to ask: if investors increasingly view stocks as stores of value like Bitcoin or gold, does that lessen the importance of macroeconomic fundamentals? 

Are we increasingly buying into a narrative based on scarcity rather than relying on hard economic data? 

Is there a shift in perspective underway and would it be sustainable or will traditional fundamental analysis remain crucial for evaluating investments.",2025-03-08 15:19:56,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j6jbvv/are_stock_valuations_simply_a_product_of_investor/

1j1rt79,Which companies/funds will be hit hard in next major market downturn?,"So in every major market downturn a lot of companies are brought down even those that may not be expected. 

For example in the Dot com bubble in addition to tech stocks you had the collapse of Enron and MCI Worldcom. 

In 2008 in addition to bank stocks you had insurance such as AIG, big three automakers, General Electric etc.

2020 you had a lot of retailers that had been struggling for years file for bankruptcy.

Here are my predictions of who/what will be impacted:

*  Crypto - Too many meme coins and speculation. There will be a massive correction due soon not sure if as severe as 2022 but its coming
* Office Space REITS- some of these have recovered but I don't see their finances improving anytime soon as return to office has been very gradual. Also recent federal cuts will hurt demand especially in suburban office space markets.
* Meme Stocks in particular Tesla and Game stop. Telsa's PE ratio is way too high and Musk's recent antics have hurt future sales prospects. Gamestop also has way too high of a PE ratio. In a downturn people will turn away and its price will collapse
* Broadcast /Cable companies - These companies are struggling with cord cutting. In a downturn this will be first thing many consumers cut. Comcast is very vulnerable. Also any regional sports stocks such as MSGE will get hit. 
* Almost every remaining regional retailer that is publicly traded. I'm not sure how many of these are honestly left but any non national retailer that does not have a decent web presence will have a decent chance of not surviving next downturn. 
* AI related stocks. Companies have been spending hundreds of billions for their AI buildout. There will be cuts to AI budgets that not only impact NVDA and AI oriented stocks, but any REITs that own data centers, power companies doing build outs 
* Oil and Gas companies. US production has increase significantly even after blip during pandemic. Due to higher drilling costs in the US expect any dip in oil price to wipe out a lot of producers especially if they are too leveraged in debt.

1izkzc2,"Curious about TSLA and co-mingling with SpaceX, Twitter, and Starlink","Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).  And has been sued for trying to manipulate stock prices [through outrageous claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-sec-lawsuit-twitter-d2640adc) and [non-disclosure](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musk-sued-by-twitter-investors-delayed-disclosure-stake-2022-05-26/).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?  I mean, when most companies spin off another entity, there's usually some sort of compensation, right?

1iyb55q,NVDA earnings expectations are way too high,"Just saw on Bloomberg - NVDA is ‚Äúcheapest in a while‚Äù because p/e is ‚Äú30‚Äù. This market is still euphoric - I guarantee many analysts have not been phased by the deep seek news - after this news every single person should have become skeptical of using forward p/e or as mentioned on Bloomberg ‚Äúp/e‚Äù. 

What is trailing p/e vs forward p/e?

p/e represents the multiple that investors pay for each $ of company earnings

Trailing uses last years REAL earnings, for NVDA this is at ~50 (currently about +10 or more higher than all other stocks besides Tesla- which btw is still just a car company- check their income statement. 

Forward uses PROJECTED EARNINGS - this is your 30 p/e and if you‚Äôre no skeptical about this after the deep seek news

EUPHORIA

Edit: because some users seem to think I would never at any time buy a growth stocks based on this theory‚Ä¶

I 100% would buy growth stocks- in fact, I own some NVDA through ETFs and have owned even more up until very recently. My argument is that much of the calculation of forward p/e that makes NVDA seem relatively ‚Äúcheap‚Äù at 30 is made up on high expectations that were pricing in immense amounts of demand that even without the deep seek news needed to be near perfect yet now we have all this macro news on top of that to make the risk higher.

I can go further by saying the market is as levered as it‚Äôs ever been with margin accounts accruing debits nearly surpassing the post-Covid inflation money printing bubble. The only difference between the speculation then and the speculation now is that a HUGE amount of the money this time is sitting in that 3 TRILLION dollar market cap.",2025-02-26 00:59:07,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iyb55q/nvda_earnings_expectations_are_way_too_high/
1ixvmn7,The Bull Case for¬†Xpeng ($XPEV),"**Why Xpeng stock ($XPEV) can 5x to hit US$100 (and beyond?) by end-2026**

Below is a condensed report, drop me a PM if you want to know more. Also, if China stocks are not your thing, either risk-, political-, personal-, or other-wise, kindly ignore. I was not paid or sponsored to write this and do not have glowing EV or AI credentials, but I have been diligently researching and studying the EV industry (including Xpeng) since 2020.

**INTRODUCTION**

Xpeng is a Chinese EV maker headed by CEO He Xiaopeng, with dual listings in the USA and Hong Kong. Its current price as of today is around US$19.5 with a market capitalization of around US$18.6 billion.

But is it really just an automaker? I‚Äôd argue Xpeng is in fact a software company providing full-stack AI mobility solutions, and seems hugely underestimated by analysts and markets alike. Here‚Äôs why Xpeng could see large growth in the coming years, perhaps hitting US$100 by end-2026 (or \~US$100 billion market cap), using a simple SWOT analysis.

**STRENGTHS**¬†

1. **Product & Design:**¬†Xpeng‚Äôs cars have always had aesthetics in mind, with their latest P7+ and sub-brand MONA M03 sedans‚Äô stylish looks, best-in-class comfort, and large space now huge bestsellers in China. Xpeng is now the 3rd best selling EV carmaker in China at the moment, behind BYD, Wuling, and Geely.
2. **Affordability:**¬†Xpeng cars are kept affordable while retaining many luxury and tech features, providing good value-for-money.
3. **Cutting-edge Technology & Features:**¬†Outstanding Xpeng tech includes an in-house powertrain integrated with the vehicle chassis, plus outstanding autonomous driving capabilities and smart features.
4. **Strong Leadership Team:**¬†In 2023, CEO Xiaopeng and President Wang Fengying overhauled the management team, rooted out corruption, eradicated departmental inefficiencies, and shifted to a more user-centric focus. The CEO remains humble and fully committed to building the company to reach greater heights.
5. **Strong Supply Chain, Marketing & Branding Management:**¬†After a tumultuous 2022 and 2023, Xpeng‚Äôs product, marketing, and supply chain teams are now all working harmoniously to swiftly ramp up production and deliver blockbuster hits one after another.
6. **Financials:**¬†The¬†[CEO has recently hinted at a¬†breakeven quarter this year](https://cnevpost.com/2025/02/07/xpeng-expects-break-even-single-quarter-2025/),¬†which will be a pivotal turning point for the company and change in valuation metrics.

**WEAKNESSES**

1. **Low Brand Strength & Perception:**¬†Xpeng is slowly but surely growing its reputation in China and overseas, with stronger sales.
2. **Intense Industry Competition & Price Wars Creating Margin Erosion:**¬†Might not necessarily be a weakness since competition breeds innovation and efficiency (see Deepseek). Moreover, Xpeng has several cost advantages, such as Gigapresses and joint raw materials purchases with partner Volkswagen.

**OPPORTUNITIES**¬†

1. **Strong 2025 Pipeline:**¬†2025 official target deliveries is 380‚Äì400,000. However looking at their strong pipeline, especially for L3 autonomous driving, I am forecasting 450‚Äì500,000 deliveries for this year, with a possibility of attaining 800,000+ EV deliveries for 2026.
2. **Autonomous Driving (AD) & Self Driving Cars:**¬†Xpeng is a strong contender for this race, with the CEO declaring in January 2025 they will achieve Quasi-L3 AD by mid-2025 and Full L3 AD by end of 2025.
3. **Flying Cars:**¬†Xpeng‚Äôs Land Aircraft Carrier (modular van and flying eVTOL module) will start deliveries in 2026 (no, this is not a wild going-by-faith projection, the¬†[factory is currently under construction with target completion in 3Q 2025](https://cnevpost.com/2024/10/27/xpeng-aeroht-flying-car-base-breaks-ground/)). Their entry will shake up the low-altitude economy due to its mass production capabilities, cost advantages, and synergies with EV production and technology. But don't expect this business to have a huge impact on the stock by itself.
4. **Humanoid Robots:**¬†Xpeng‚Äôs bipedal, all-purpose Iron Robots have already been deployed in Xpeng‚Äôs factories and stores, and are expected to enter trial commercial use in the second half of 2025, meaning commercial use may come in 2026, including¬†**talking and moving like humans.**¬†Much potential in this enormous space for Xpeng, which has several differences in its robot tech from its peers (with the CEO just saying he is confident¬†[Xpeng will deploy one of the earliest mass-produced L3 robots in China](https://m.weibo.cn/status/5137890441693096)).
5. **AI Car Chips:**¬†Xpeng will mass-produce their potentially game-changing Turing AI chip in mid-2025 (3x the computing power of industry standard Nvidia's Drive Orin-X), where it will set off a chain motion of new product launches. Possible to be adopted by other automakers too. Angus McKenzie from Motortrend has speculated that if Xpeng‚Äôs Turing Chip lives up to its full potential, it could be a [Deepseek moment for the car industry](https://www.motortrend.com/news/xpeng-develops-ai-chip-deepseek-moment/).¬†
6. **Robocars & Robotaxis:**¬†The final step in autonomous driving (L4/L5 AD), and with endless possibilities: From transportation to food delivery to mobile convenience stores to F&B to ecommerce deliveries. Coupled with Iron Robot can achieve wonders in any industry.
7. **Global Expansion:**¬†Xpeng car sales are accelerating around the world, with a targeted presence in 60 countries by end of 2025, compared to 30 as of end 2024.
8. **Increasing Partnerships & Institutional Investors:**¬†Existing partnerships and investments by Volkswagen may deepen, and institutional investors (domestic or foreign) may start to invest in Xpeng as it becomes recognized worldwide.

**THREATS**¬†

1. **Competition:**¬†There is always intense¬†**price competition**¬†in the EV sector, whether in China or overseas. However, Xpeng is in a sweet spot of value for money and product, and will continue to attract customers in the entry-level range.¬†**Competition in autonomous driving**¬†is fierce, and there‚Äôs a chance another car company unlocks L3 and L4 before Xpeng. However, Xpeng will get there eventually too, and it has other prospects, plus it can always catch up and outshine with its robocar offerings. Some may also be worried that¬†**copycats**¬†will mimic Xpeng‚Äôs popular car models bolt for bolt, but it‚Äôs not so simple as Xpeng has built up a decade‚Äôs worth of proprietary innovation and expertise in building cutting-edge EVs. And will continue to do so.
2. **Loss of Innovation:**¬†Xpeng depends heavily on its tech innovation to stand out. Loss of key men may cause a brain drain and loss of technological edge. Xpeng is tackling this by recruiting the best and brightest, and heavily invested in R&D.
3. **Geopolitical Tensions:**¬†I believe a¬†**major war is very unlikely**¬†under the current Trump administration. But increasing friction between USA and China may spark another call for¬†**delisting of China ADRs**, which if comes to pass will create volatility in the stock prices, but I feel Xpeng‚Äôs stock will eventually recover and push higher as the company performs well (will have small forex risk though). USA may also decide to¬†**tighten EV chip restrictions**¬†on China automakers, but that will not affect Xpeng as it transitions to its own Turing Chip for all its products in mid-2025 (may turn out to be a boon instead as competitors falter).
4. **Global or Domestic Economic Softness:**¬†Any economic slowdown in China or the rest of the world will have a mixed effect on Xpeng‚Äôs position as an affordable, mass market, smart EV brand. A slowdown could actually spur more consumers to go for bang-for-their-buck cars, and Xpeng fits the bill perfectly.

**SUMMARY**

Do you want to own a company that can potentially change the world? Xpeng could turn out to be the¬†**Tesla of China, Figure AI of China, Archer Aviation of China, Nvidia of Cars: All rolled into one!**

The risk reward looks tremendously positive. And the worst case I can see right now is the stock goes sideways due to inexplicable stagnation in its domestic and overseas EV car business, PLUS all its other exciting prospects‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAutonomous Driving, Flying Cars, AI Chips, Robots, Robocars‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfall flat.

BUT, in a good scenario (not necessarily the best case even), if one or two of Xpeng‚Äôs businesses blast off?¬†A review of each and my estimated valuations (now and end-2026, with estimated annual sales):

1. **EV Cars (Semi-AD)**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCurrent (**L2 AD**, 300K annual sales): US$18 Billion | End 2026 (**L3 AD**, 800K-1M sales + huge/growing orderbook): US$50‚Äì60 Billion¬†*(Benchmarked against BYD & Li Auto valuation)*
2. **Flying Cars**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCurrent (3K orderbook): US$1 Billion | End 2026 (10K sales + 10‚Äì30K orderbook, depends on type): US$5‚Äì20 Billion¬†*(*[*Benchmarked against Archer Aviation valuation*](https://investors.archer.com/news/news-details/2024/Archer-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Demonstrating-Manufacturing-Certification-and-Commercial-Launch-Momentum/default.aspx)*)*
3. **Robots**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCurrent: Nil | End 2026 (5‚Äì10K sales + 10‚Äì100K orderbook): US$5‚Äì60 Billion¬†*(Wildcard, Enormous potential,*¬†[*Benchmarked against Figure AI valuation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-14/robotics-startup-figure-ai-in-talks-for-new-funding-at-39-5-billion-valuation)*)*
4. **AI Chips**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCurrent: Nil | End 2026 (0‚Äì20K orderbook + partnerships): US$2‚Äì20 Billion¬†*(Big wildcard at the moment)*
5. **Robocars (Full-AD)**‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäCurrent: Nil | End 2026 (10‚Äì50K orderbook + partnerships): US$5‚Äì40 Billion¬†*(Enormous potential,*¬†[*Benchmarked against Waymo & Tesla valuation*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-waymo-stock-tesla-robotaxis-29a57e01)¬†*with big haircut)*

Is this so ridiculous? Bear in mind Tesla‚Äôs sky high valuation for its future autonomous driving, robot, and robocar plays. Now Xpeng is valued at a mere 1.8% of Tesla. A major product breakthrough can trigger a sharp bull run for Xpeng, cause short-sellers to stay away, and maybe turn it into a meme stock. Just my 2 cents.

1inu9y7,Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?,"I‚Äôm not a Tesla expert, and I‚Äôm sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla‚Äôs stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I‚Äôm struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.

Here‚Äôs a list of what bothers me:

1. **Elon Musk‚Äôs PR Nightmare** ‚Äì It‚Äôs hard to ignore how much Musk‚Äôs public image has deteriorated. Between the ‚ÄúSieg Heil‚Äù incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he‚Äôs lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla‚Äôs brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** ‚Äì Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that‚Äôs no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that‚Äôs valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** ‚Äì The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla‚Äôs next big thing, but it‚Äôs turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it‚Äôs starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** ‚Äì Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla‚Äôs self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla‚Äôs claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there‚Äôs a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** ‚Äì Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs alignment with Musk‚Äôs political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla‚Äôs market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they‚Äôre slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I‚Äôve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

What do you think? Am I missing something, or is Tesla headed for some rough times ahead?",2025-02-12 16:02:59,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1inu9y7/is_the_tesla_bubble_about_to_pop/

Musk, the richest man on earth, borrows money against his valuable stock. If the stock isn't as valuable will he be forced to make his other companies (X, SpaceX etc) public?

1ik5337,Chinese Markets are Rejecting Tesla,"China Is Moving On from Tesla  
  
Tesla‚Äôs dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to new report from CNBC, Tesla‚Äôs sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It‚Äôs not just a sales dip, it‚Äôs a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla‚Äôs profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla‚Äôs core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China‚Äôs policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

Tesla‚Äôs Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations",2025-02-07 20:39:55,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ik5337/chinese_markets_are_rejecting_tesla/
1ijwa8v,Hedge strategy for a tech heavy portfolio ?,"Hey,

I'm long term bullish on tesla, some things musk did lately bothered me but overall I still believe in the long term self driving and humanoid robots, even if it happens years later than expected.

And I hold bitcoin, bullish on it.


So overall this portfolio has potential long term, but lacks any sort of hedging and diversification I totally feel that.

At the point I'm at, I can see myself having my portfolio slashed 50% in 1 month, i can see that happen, so I wanna put the new money elsewhere, but also keep my current positions that I'm bullish on, as they are.


I don't really wanna get into sp500 as it is, as it's so tech boosted, and I'm already so exposed to tech.

I soon expect to get alot of new returns tha I plan to invest somewhere else, to keep the growth/ speculative part as I have and not touch it.

And create the other part that aims to give like stable returns, and hold pretty well in a black swan or bear market type event.
So I want to avoid speculative future projection tech sort of stuff, that also includes the sp500.
I don't want FAANG stocks, apple nvidia google etc, some are more hyped than others and some are probably not so bad I know tesla is a nig one, but still I wanna keep out of it as I'm already in it.

And perhaps I also don't want to be too correlated with united states alone.

Any sort of perhaps actively managed etf, that perhaps has some cash, some long positions on boring stuff

And some shorts on bad/scam/useless companies ? And maybe 25% of portfolio being shorts ?

With long term annual returns of maybe like 7-8% a year. And a better resilience in a bear market situation, due to low speculation(tech) exposure, and some shorts that would in that case be in green.

So overall maybe slight underperformance of sp500, but better resilience and less volatility. With still decent 8% a year gains, is that reasonable to ask for ?

It's important that it has atleast like 6-7 years of track record

Anyone knows a good etf for that ? Or some form of investment that can do something like this ?

1ii7cew,There is either too much money in the system or people are learining how ti invest,"I am absolutely passionate about investing and I have been for years, with results way above my expectations. I am noticing however that most companies are being priced correctly.

I am not talking about hyper exuberant companies (Tesla, Palantir...) but most blue chip stocks.   
Microsoft, Google, Visa, Mastercard (1.5-3% FCFY plus strong growth) .. but also less growth oriented companies like Pepsi, Kroger... (4-5% FCFY and a bit of growth)... Railways are more stable, so they trade between 3-5% FCY, are all trading around fair value IMO.

Actually I think the equity risk premium is a bit down and right know stocks are fairly priced with respect to treasuries (4-5% FCY, no growth). IMO there are still some attractive opportunities (bought uber last month), but the market is behaving quite well. 

Maybe this is the results of too much money in the system, desperately competing for limited assets, but I also think that people learning about the stock market (and flooding to ETFs) are making it more efficient, not less. 

I am not complaining, I think its ok that people are no longer over ridicolously cheap opportunities. Investing shouldn't be easy, so seeing fair prices is kind of good. Its not the mother of all bubbles, its actually fair that you don't make 15% per year while doing nothing. 

In short, congratulation to everybody that is consistently staying invested in the market, you are doing great and I am happy for you.

1ihklb7,Tesla over valued should it be shorted?,"
Over the past few years, Tesla‚Äôs stock has been propelled by a narrative of future technological breakthroughs and visionary leadership. However, a closer look at the underlying fundamentals‚Äîand in particular a comparison with Chinese giant BYD‚Äîreveals several concerning points:
	
1.	Superior Sales and Market Penetration of BYD
	‚Ä¢	In 2022, BYD sold approximately 1.86 million new energy vehicles worldwide, compared with Tesla‚Äôs 1.31 million deliveries globally (with only about 440,000 delivered in China) [ Ôøº].
	
‚Ä¢	BYD‚Äôs sales figures reflect its diversified product portfolio‚Äîfrom affordable passenger EVs to commercial vehicles and buses‚Äîwhich has allowed it to capture a larger share of the rapidly expanding global market.
	
‚Ä¢	Prominent voices like Charlie Munger have even remarked that in China, ‚ÄúBYD is so much ahead of Tesla that it‚Äôs almost ridiculous,‚Äù noting that while Tesla has been forced to reduce prices repeatedly, BYD has maintained a pricing discipline that reinforces its quality perception [ Ôøº].
	
2.	Integrated Vertical Model and Proprietary IP
	‚Ä¢	BYD‚Äôs business model is built on deep vertical integration. It manufactures everything from battery cells (including its innovative blade battery) to complete battery packs, ensuring tighter quality control, faster innovation cycles, and cost efficiencies.
	
‚Ä¢	In contrast, Tesla‚Äôs battery strategy still depends heavily on external suppliers such as CATL, Panasonic, and LG Energy Solution. While Tesla touts its in-house 4680 cell as revolutionary, independent analysis shows that its energy density improvements (in Wh/kg) are modest compared to the rapid progress made by competitors [see discussion below].
	
‚Ä¢	BYD‚Äôs extensive R&D and robust portfolio of patents in battery technology (and its willingness to license technology to other automakers) suggest that its technological edge isn‚Äôt just hype‚Äîit translates into real, scalable production improvements. Tesla‚Äôs reliance on external providers leaves it vulnerable if those suppliers or competing integrated players (like BYD) drive down costs and improve performance.
	
3.	Limited Technological Differentiation on Core Battery Metrics
	
‚Ä¢	A key metric for EV performance is energy density (Wh/kg). Despite much fanfare around Tesla‚Äôs battery innovations, the improvements in energy density aren‚Äôt dramatically superior to those achieved by BYD and other leading manufacturers.
	
‚Ä¢	This calls into question whether Tesla‚Äôs premium valuation‚Äîbuilt largely on future expectations‚Äîcan be sustained if its core battery technology isn‚Äôt materially better. BYD, on the other hand, combines modest improvements in battery performance with a proven, fully integrated production process that has already translated into higher sales volumes and broader market acceptance.
	
4.	The Overvaluation Argument and Market Sentiment
	
‚Ä¢	Tesla‚Äôs current market valuation appears to be based on an almost irrational optimism about future robotaxis, autonomous driving, and energy storage breakthroughs‚Äînone of which have yet materially improved the company‚Äôs profitability or production volumes.
	
‚Ä¢	With BYD now not only supplying its own vehicles but also securing contracts as a battery supplier for other major players (including recent agreements where BYD‚Äôs FinDreams unit is set to supply Tesla‚Äôs Shanghai energy storage facility [ Ôøº]), the narrative that Tesla is the sole leader in battery innovation is weakening.
	
‚Ä¢	When you combine lower vehicle sales numbers, an overreliance on third-party suppliers, and only modest improvements in battery performance, the rationale behind Tesla‚Äôs high valuation starts to crumble. Investors may eventually reprice Tesla based on its current fundamentals rather than its lofty future projections.

Conclusion

From this perspective, the argument for shorting Tesla centers on the idea that:
	
‚Ä¢	BYD‚Äôs strong global sales, robust vertical integration, and advanced battery IP are not only outpacing Tesla in key markets (especially in China) but also provide a more sustainable competitive advantage.
	
‚Ä¢	Tesla‚Äôs reliance on external suppliers and its relatively modest improvements in core battery metrics (like energy density) suggest that its premium valuation is built on an overly optimistic narrative.
	
‚Ä¢	If market sentiment shifts away from these future promises and begins to focus on near-term fundamentals, Tesla could see a significant correction.


Had gpt organize my info dump in a readable format . But byd is clearly a company that should be valued more it makes no sense that tesla has it‚Äôs current valuation. Also throw in global anti American economic sentiment and anti elon well. Seems to make sense that their stock will decline.

1idb98p,Elon indicating battery production issues in earnings call today. Could possible acquisition be a solution for Tesla?,"TO ALL MY HIGH RISK SPECULATIVE INVESTORS!

I know some of you have probably heard about this juicy rumor floating around that Tesla might be looking at acquiring $QS and if you haven't, well its out there and Elon just stated the reason why on todays earnings call.

Elon said - ""Right now, the constraint we're trying to solve is battery production, rather than demand."" So you know they're sweating bullets over their battery issues, working overtime to fix this shit.

Now, the issue is that Elon Musk has historically been content with lithium-ion batteries for Tesla's vehicles, citing the cost implications of adopting solid-state technology at scale. So in order for this rumor to come true and for QS to send us regards (myself included) to the multi-millionaire club, QS must be able to have a revolutionary solid-state Lithium battery AND be able to show that these batteries can be mass-produced cheaply at a large scale.

Just to be crystal clear: THIS IS A SUPER HIGH RISK play because there is a chance that $QS won't be able to figure out how to make these batteries affordable. As always, do your DD before you buy. 

Volkswagen has already made significant investments into $QS, but who the tf wants to drive an electric VW loaded with top-of-the-line revolutionary batteries anyways?

1ibbqer,Third Coast Bancshares: Continued Growth In A Booming Region,"I have been covering numerous small & mid cap banks for quite some time now and I am bullish on the continued growth of many names. TCBX is based in the high-growth Texas metropolitan areas with very impressive growth despite the fact Texas has more banks than any other state. Here is my analysis on this particular community bank:

Hope to hear from everyone on their thoughts on this company / the future outlook on financials

# Macro Overview:

* **Economic Strength of Texas:**¬†Third Coast operates in Texas, whom remain one of the fastest-growing states in the U.S. that recently¬†[grew at 4.2% in Q3 2024](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis)), faster than the nation as a whole. Business friendly policies like no state income tax, have helped corporate relocation's like Tesla, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard. Texas's economy is the¬†[eighth-largest](https://gov.texas.gov/business/page/texas-economic-snapshot#:~:text=(Texas%20Comptroller%20of%20Public%20Accounts,U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis))¬†when compared to nations of the world and is now valued at $2.6 trillion. Texas is expected to continue to grow and with that the need for lending capabilities should favor Third Coast.
* **Impact of Potential Deregulation:**¬†[Deregulation is expected to play a pivotal role](https://www.thebanker.com/content/05e97cf7-7d6a-580d-91cb-d27cd4d03092)¬†in the new administrations economic agenda. For community banks like Third Coast, this will allow them the ability to operate more freely with relaxed capital requirements. With fewer regulatory requirements, Third Coast can selectively increase their exposure to higher yielding loans and potential acquisitions. Typically, the ability to freely lend boosts bank earnings and growth. It allows the industry the flexibility to regulate themselves. With deregulation almost certain, focusing on further risk-taking is important. This approach may lead to increases in nonperforming loans down the line.

# Investment Thesis:

* **Presence In A High-Growth Region:**¬†Texas has one of the strongest economies in the U.S. consistently outpacing the national GDP growth rate. Third Coast has shown a great track record of impressive growth with a CAGR of over 25% and EPS growth of over 18% from 2020 to 2024. Deregulation in the banking industry is all but certain in the coming months. This will lead to increased lending capabilities that will fuel additional growth in a region that continues to outperform. Third Coast's lending increased 9% to $3.97 billion. Urban centers like Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston are hubs for technology, energy, and manufacturing. In particular, residential construction is anticipated to rebound in 2025 fueled by increased populations, jobs, and incomes.
* **Current Valuation:**¬†Third Coast has a P/E (TTM) of 14.65, slightly below the¬†[industry average of 14.8](https://simplywall.st/markets/us/financials/banks). Yet, the stock has risen over 93% in the last year alone and is just -2.5% from its 52-week high of $37.65. Despite the significant increase, Third Coast is still slightly undervalued. It is significantly under their five-year average high P/E of 16.9. With continued growth expected in the long-term, we believe it is best to either wait for a potential pullback, or continue holding.
* **Strong Financial Results:**¬†Fierce competition in Texas is intense with hundreds of banks. Nevertheless, Third Coast has achieved impressive results since their 2021 IPO. Revenue has increased 80%, EPS 194%, and net income 317%. Profitability metrics like return on average assets, return on average equity, and net profit margin have set new records. They have hit highs of 1.05%, 11.48%, and 27.82%, respectively. Nonperforming assets did however increase by 48.7% to 0.58% of total assets. While increases are not desired, the total is still significantly under the industry average indicating proper risk management for now.

# Loan Growth & Quality

* **Nonperforming loans:**¬†Often, solid loan growth comes with risky lending practices. Third Coast predominately lends to CRE and C&I, combined accounting for almost 60% of the total portfolio. Nonperforming loans increased by 61.4% to $27.95 million. A large reason for such a major increase stemmed from C&I accounting for over 51% of nonperforming loans. Non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans accounted for 39%. Fortunately, non-farm non-residential owner occupied loans decreased -14% despite their 11.3% weighting.
* **Nonperforming assets:**¬†Unsurprisingly, nonperforming assets increased by 48.7% as a result. Currently, nonperforming assets are only at 0.58% which is still minor for a community bank. We do not want to see a continuation of nonperforming assets. They can easily start to wipe out a bank's equity. Third Coast has grown fantastically, as has nonperforming loans and assets. Both are now at all-time highs for the banks. We will be monitoring this development in the upcoming quarters to ensure this does not rapidly continue.

# Earnings Overview

* **Revenue:**¬†Fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 16% to $171.38 million. Third Coast benefited from a 15.2% increase in net-interest income due to elevated interest rates. This allowed the bank to reprice loans at higher yields. Floating-rate loans especially boosted interest income, despite rising deposit costs. Total non-interest income also saw impressive growth of 29.4% to $10.62 million contributing to the overall increase in revenue.
* **Net Income:**¬†An impressive increase of 42.7% lead to a total of $47.67 million. This increase was primarily the result of increased net interest income, resulting from loan growth.
* **EPS:**¬†Earnings per share saw strength with growth of 40.4% to $2.78. Higher revenue, controlled cost management, and rising profitability were the primarily reasons for such an increase.",2025-01-27 15:28:40,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ibbqer/third_coast_bancshares_continued_growth_in_a/

1hzif6o,Clients' returns and the stock company's profits are at odds with each other,"I've worked as an asset manager, helping people manage their investments. My main focus is on designing retirement plans, especially for young clients. 

Here's the dilemma I face. I firmly believe in long-term investing in S&P500 or Nasdaq100 index funds, and that's what I advise my clients to do for their retirement planning from their early age.

The problem arises with short- and medium-term investments. 

The more frequently my clients buy and sell individual stocks, the higher the fees I earn, which makes me wealthier. Leverage stocks like 3x tesla have much higher fees than index funds as you know.  

But clients who trade frequently tend to see lower returns over time. On the other hand, those who simply buy index funds consistently or hold onto blue-chip stocks like google or micorsoft for the long term usually achieve much better returns.

Of course, these long-term investors don‚Äôt generate as much revenue for me. Yet, I often find myself advising clients not to trade too often, even though I know this reduces my own income. 

It feels ironic that the system is designed so that frequent trading benefits the stock companies or asset managers, but not the investors themselves.",2025-01-12 08:34:34,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hzif6o/clients_returns_and_the_stock_companys_profits/

1hvvgf2,The potential AI stocks in 2025,"When think of AI stocks, the first names that come to my mind is $NVDA and $MSFT. NVIDIA dominates the AI hardware market with its GPU technology, while Microsoft, through its partnership with OpenAI, has become a benchmark in the AI software space.

Meanwhile, Applovin ($APP) has excelled in AI-driven advertising, with its stock price doubling in November, attracting widespread attention. But beyond these giants, there are still many ""hidden champions"" lurking among the small-cap stocks.

For example, $BBAI, which focuses on defense AI, and UiPath ($PATH), specializing in enterprise automation, have garnered attention from the capital markets due to their deep market positioning.

But, I am currently eyeing on $BGM's recent stock price fluctuations.

Recently, BGM completed its acquisition of AIFU‚Äôs insurance platform, marking a significant step in its transformation into the AI insurance sector. AIFU‚Äôs ‚ÄúDuXiaoBao‚Äù platform, powered by Baidu‚Äôs big data, is a prime example of such integration. It combines Baidu‚Äôs 704 million monthly active users with AIFU‚Äôs 48 million insurance sales network. Currently, the platform covers over 16.8 million customers and 17.5 million households. With BGM‚Äôs integration of medical resources, the user base and insurance coverage are expected to expand significantly, driving explosive growth for the company.

Traditional insurance sales rely on broker networks, but ""DuXiaoBao"" is changing the game by using Baidu and AIFU‚Äôs deep data models to offer tailored insurance solutions. In the future, it might even analyze users‚Äô lifestyle and health data to predict their health risks over the next 30 years and design personalized insurance products based on that. Imagine if AI told you there was a 95% chance you‚Äôd be sick in the next 20-30 years and recommended an insurance product accordingly‚Äîwould you buy it? This ‚Äúsmart + privacy‚Äù insurance sales model is truly disruptive.

This approach bears a striking similarity to Tesla‚Äôs innovation: Tesla used vehicle data to personalize car insurance, disrupting the traditional auto insurance industry, while BGM is using big data to empower insurance products, revolutionizing the customer experience.

Looking ahead, BGM might even leverage OpenAI‚Äôs technology to take the ""DuXiaoBao"" platform global, offering personalized health and insurance services to users worldwide. This vision of globalization and technological integration opens up even greater growth potential for the company.

BGM‚Äôs market cap is currently just around $60 million, compared to insurance giants like Prudential (market cap around $21.7 billion) and Prudential Financial (market cap around $46.1 billion), which are dozens of times its size.

1hvhjnt,Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets,"**Summary**

* Uber‚Äôs stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber‚Äôs strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google‚Äôs Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber‚Äôs stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber‚Äôs advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google‚Äôs evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber‚Äôs investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber‚Äôs ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber‚Äôs management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta‚Äôs successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber‚Äôs business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility‚Äîincluding cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access‚Äîsupport Uber‚Äôs long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber‚Äôs margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber‚Äôs EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber‚Äôs revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%‚Äîa compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber‚Äôs forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber‚Äôs long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

1hvcot5,This is why we dont buy Chinese stocks: US Dept of Defense Labels Tencent a military company ,"
From [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline?embedded-checkout=true):

The U.S. Department of Defense has added Tencent Holdings and CATL to its blacklist of companies allegedly linked to China's military, causing Tencent's U.S.-listed shares to drop nearly 10%. This move is part of the Pentagon's ""Section 1260H list,"" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.

Tencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.

While the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.

Both Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.

1hv5dc3,Tesla's Deliveries Disappoint: Time To Take Profits (Rating Downgrade),"**Summary**

* Tesla's stock remains overvalued despite disappointing vehicle delivery numbers and slowing growth.
* The surge in Tesla's stock price is driven by enthusiasm for AI advancements, Elon Musk's charisma, and Donald Trump's election victory rather than improvements in the company's core business fundamentals.
* At 126 times projected earnings, Tesla‚Äôs valuation is far higher than both industry peers and even Nvidia, making it increasingly difficult to justify its current price.
* The company's challenges, including declining deliveries, suggest that much of its upside potential has already been priced in.
* Investors should consider taking profits while the stock is trading at near-record highs.

Tesla‚Äôs stock has been riding a wave of unprecedented enthusiasm, with its price reaching all-time highs despite recently published delivery numbers that fell short of analysts' expectations. This discrepancy highlights a growing disconnect between Tesla‚Äôs market valuation and its actual performance. The company, once known for its relentless growth and innovation, delivered fewer cars in 2024 than in 2023, marking its first-ever year of declining deliveries. Despite this, Tesla‚Äôs stock price has surged by 63% in 2024, demonstrating how much investor sentiment rather than fundamental growth is driving its valuation.

In my October analysis, I discussed how Tesla‚Äôs slowing delivery growth and declining net income, despite aggressive price cuts, were becoming evident concerns. Even the highly anticipated robotaxi event failed to deliver the excitement that investors had hoped for, leading to a drop in the stock price at the time. While Tesla was already trading at a premium then, its valuation has only become more stretched in the months since.

The most recent data on Tesla‚Äôs deliveries reveals troubling trends. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company delivered 495,570 vehicles, falling short of the 512,300 deliveries expected by analysts. This shortfall contributed to a total of 1.79 million vehicles delivered for the year, a slight decline from the 1.81 million delivered in 2023. While the drop in deliveries may seem modest, it is significant as it breaks Tesla‚Äôs streak of consistent year-over-year growth, which had previously been a hallmark of its success. This is especially notable given the company‚Äôs reliance on vehicle sales for approximately 80% of its revenue. Without sustained growth in this area, the rationale for holding Tesla as a growth stock diminishes considerably.

From 2020 to 2023, Tesla experienced remarkable growth in deliveries, with annual numbers climbing steadily. However, 2024 marked a departure from this trend, with sales stagnating and then declining. Quarterly delivery figures also highlight the slowdown, with growth peaking in the second quarter of 2023 and subsequently stalling. This lack of growth is especially concerning for a company that reinvests all earnings into future expansion rather than paying dividends to shareholders. Tesla‚Äôs business model hinges on its ability to grow continuously, and the absence of that growth undermines its investment appeal.

Despite these challenges, Tesla‚Äôs stock has soared, buoyed by investor excitement over its advancements in artificial intelligence, Elon Musk‚Äôs magnetic persona, and the political implications of Donald Trump‚Äôs recent election victory. Musk has repeatedly emphasized Tesla‚Äôs position as a leader in AI and robotics, which has further fueled optimism among investors. Additionally, Tesla‚Äôs stock experienced significant gains following the November election, with investors speculating that Trump‚Äôs administration might ease regulations related to self-driving technology. However, such regulatory changes would only be beneficial if Tesla achieves full autonomy, an ambitious milestone that remains elusive.

Tesla‚Äôs valuation underscores the risks of the current enthusiasm. The stock is now trading at an extraordinary 126 times projected earnings, a multiple that far exceeds even AI powerhouse Nvidia, which trades at around 42 times earnings. Comparisons with legacy automakers further highlight the disparity. Tesla‚Äôs market cap of $1.2 trillion is greater than that of the next 20 largest automakers combined, yet it delivered fewer vehicles in 2024 than in 2023. This disconnect raises questions about whether Tesla‚Äôs valuation can be justified in the absence of tangible growth.

Tesla‚Äôs performance relative to Nvidia provides another perspective on the stock‚Äôs overvaluation. While both companies have benefited from their association with AI, Tesla‚Äôs stock has outperformed Nvidia‚Äôs despite facing significant headwinds in its core business. This suggests that investor enthusiasm for Tesla may be outpacing its actual achievements.

Although Tesla remains a leader in EV production and is recognized for its innovative technologies, including AI and robotics, these factors are already priced into the stock. The company‚Äôs market leadership positions it well to benefit from long-term trends in EV adoption, but its challenges in the short term, including declining deliveries and uncertain profitability from new ventures, make its current valuation appear precarious.

In conclusion, Tesla‚Äôs stock is trading at unsustainable levels given its recent performance. While the company‚Äôs technological advancements and market leadership are undeniable, its reliance on investor sentiment rather than business fundamentals makes it a risky investment at these prices. Taking profits now would allow investors to capitalize on the stock‚Äôs near-record highs while avoiding potential losses should the market reassess Tesla‚Äôs valuation. While the enthusiasm surrounding Tesla may persist in the short term, prudence suggests that this is an opportune moment to exit the position.

1hqy8vw,Bitcoin Isn‚Äôt Unique But Infinite‚Äî$100K Is Beyond Absurd,"Imagine this: air, the most abundant and freely available resource on Earth. Everyone can breathe it without restriction, it‚Äôs everywhere, and it costs nothing. Now, imagine a company decides to package this air into bottles, claiming, ‚ÄúOnly 21 million bottles will ever exist.‚Äù They sell the bottles, marketing them as rare and special, and soon, the price of a single bottle soars to $100,000.

But here‚Äôs the catch: anyone can grab the same air, bottle it themselves, impose their own arbitrary limits, and sell it too. The air inside these bottles is identical, same purity, same ability to sustain life. Yet somehow, the original company convinces people their air is unique, while the others are dismissed as worthless. This isn‚Äôt just absurd but comically irrational. And yet, it‚Äôs a perfect analogy for Bitcoin.

Think about it: bottling air to sell is ridiculous. Why would anyone pay for something that is freely and infinitely available? Worse, imagine dedicating an entire decentralized system‚Äîone consuming massive amounts of electricity, requiring complex networks, and involving global participants‚Äîto package, transfer, and store this bottled air. This is the level of absurdity we reach with Bitcoin.

Bitcoin‚Äôs defenders often point to its decentralization, anonymity, and capped supply of 21 million coins as reasons for its value. But what is this decentralized system really securing? Digital air. The units being produced, transferred, and protected represent nothing‚Äîthey are infinitely replicable tokens that anyone can create at any time. Anyone with the technical knowledge can clone Bitcoin‚Äôs code, impose their own arbitrary cap, and launch their own cryptocurrency.

This brings us to the critical difference between Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies) and other financial assets like stocks or fiat currencies: cryptocurrencies represent nothing and are inherently limitless.

Stocks represent ownership in a company. A company cannot be copied like a piece of code. The value of a share is tied to the performance, assets, and operations of that unique entity. You cannot clone Tesla or Apple, and therefore, you cannot duplicate the value tied to their stocks. Stocks are inherently scarce because companies themselves are finite, tied to real-world assets, operations, and innovation.

Fiat currencies, on the other hand, represent units of debt. They are issued by central banks and commercial banks through loans and bonds based on the ability of borrowers‚Äîcompanies, governments, or individuals‚Äîto repay them. Banks cannot create money infinitely because it is tied to the real-world capacity of debtors to meet their obligations. No one can walk into a bank and request a trillion-dollar loan without collateral or a realistic ability to repay it.

Cryptocurrencies operate under no such constraints. If you wanted to create a trillion crypto tokens tomorrow, nothing stops you. Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million coin cap is arbitrary and meaningless because anyone can copy the Bitcoin protocol, adjust the parameters, and produce trillions of coins in their own system. In this way, cryptocurrencies represent nothing‚Äîno ownership, no debt, no tangible connection to the real economy. They are the digital equivalent of bottling air, infinitely replicable with no inherent value.

Bitcoin‚Äôs defenders argue that its capped supply makes it valuable, likening it to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity is artificial and replicable. Limiting Bitcoin to 21 million units is no different than bottling air and claiming, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only producing 21 million bottles.‚Äù The air is still abundant, and anyone else can create their own bottles with their own arbitrary limits.

The absurdity deepens when you consider the massive resources dedicated to securing, transferring, and storing these digital tokens. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than entire nations, and yet what is being protected? A digital representation of air, something freely available, infinitely replicable, and ultimately meaningless.

Bitcoin‚Äôs price doesn‚Äôt reflect the value of its features. If decentralization, anonymity, and security were truly valuable, Bitcoin‚Äôs clones, many of which improve on these features, would share its valuation. Instead, Bitcoin‚Äôs price is fueled by speculation and the collective illusion that it is unique. People aren‚Äôt paying $100,000 because Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency; they‚Äôre paying because they believe someone else will pay more.

This speculative bubble cannot last. Once people recognize that Bitcoin‚Äôs features are infinitely replicable, and that its competitors offer the same or better functionality at a fraction of the cost, the illusion will collapse.

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt digital gold, nor is it a revolutionary asset. It‚Äôs a digital air, packaged and sold as rare and valuable despite being infinitely and freely available. Paying $100,000 for a single Bitcoin is not a testament to its worth but evidence of a collective delusion. The elaborate decentralized system supporting Bitcoin exists to secure and transfer something that anyone can recreate endlessly at no cost.

When the hype fades, and the absurdity of the system becomes clear, Bitcoin‚Äôs price will plummet, leaving behind the inescapable truth: no rational person should pay a fortune for something as abundant and meaningless as digital air.",2025-01-01 07:36:43,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hqy8vw/bitcoin_isnt_unique_but_infinite100k_is_beyond/

1hiq21y,"Every Monday morning I invest $1,885. Here is how I divvy it up, can y'all provide feedback/opinions on my investing strategy please?","I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every week which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

Stock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment
:--|:--:|--:
S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%
MAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%
Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%
Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%
Financial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%
Semiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%
Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

1hip93e,Could GOEV (Canoo Inc.) Be a Hidden Gem and at a Place When Tesla Was at $1.33 Only or When Bitcoin was but Mere Cents Only?,"Hi investing friends, could GOEV (Canoo inc., I've bought quite a significant number of shares at least significant for the budget; always with cross-referencing do your own research and trust your own instincts after the data, always doing due diligence and this is not financial advice) be a hidden gem and now at a place when Tesla was at $1.33 or when BTC was mere cents (Bitcoin even started at $0) about a decade and a half ago? It was ignored coz' no one was buying much. It's always tough to see looking forward (it's always looking back of course that one see gems that could be hidden), though I always look at who's creating what, who's the real leader and Canoo's leader seems maybe a few percentages of Elon Musk. 

The Canoo founder has a lot of patents it seems, innovative it seem similar to Elon (but not as big like Elon's pre-Tesla and SpaceX, like PayPal or Zip2) had a successful venture (Solera I think). 

But only time will tell if the pattern will repeat itself with Canoo, it has a great design, innovative, especially their MPDV (I wish that was the one they focused on but had a smaller non-van version with the same). It just needs to launch already their working models (unlike that Nikola truck which even got GM fooled) have amazing design especially the shelf mechanism of their nice looking MPDV. 

If they just did a pre-order which is a genius strategy pioneered by amazing Apple, God-willing they will break through but they also need to upgrade their battery from 200mi to 320mi for good measure. They need to launch now coz' the chinese EVs are coming with tariffs by Pres. Trump or not- it's like 'finished or not finished pass your papers.'

1hfy0q8,Ponzi Spotting: a laymen's guide to differentiating investments from Ponzi schemes,"I often see things being called Ponzi schemes on Reddit that are very much not Ponzi schemes. Usually, it always stems from the criticism that a particular investment only goes up in price because someone newer is paying a higher price for it. Hence, it must be a Ponzi.

I‚Äôm going to blow your minds a little bit.¬†

Almost all (legitimate) investments require new investors willing to pay a higher price for older investors to cash out a profit.¬†

Most investable objects, REGARDLESS of what underlies the object, trade at a price on a market. This means, at the margin, some percentage (usually only a small percentage) of the total available supply of the object is trading hands. The trade is priced typically in your local fiat currency, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. Prices are determined by supply and demand. When an investable object goes up in price on a market, it means there were no sellers of the object at the lower price, and price goes up until the next marginal seller decides they are willing to part with that object at the higher price.¬†

The use of the term investable object is intentionally left extremely broad. It essentially means anything quantifiable that can be owned and traded. This includes contracts, stocks, bonds, physical objects, digital objects, etc.¬†

**Example 1.** You bought a 1st edition charizard for 20 dollars when it came out in the 1990‚Äôs. Since it was relatively abundant (still being printed by the company) and Pokemon was relatively new at the time, the supply was high and the demand was low. Fast forward 30 years, Pokemon is super popular and there are very few 1st edition charizards remaining (out of print for decades, many were lost or destroyed through the years). You now are able to sell the charizard for 10,000 dollars to a guy that just got into Pokemon card collecting. Congratulations, you bought low and sold high! Was what you participated in a Ponzi scheme because you (an old investor) made a profit by selling to a new investor?

I really hope your answer to this is no. If you think the answer is yes, you can stop reading here, because I don‚Äôt think anything I‚Äôm going to say beyond this point is going to help you.

The next step in logic is realizing this charizard example is essentially how ALL INVESTMENT RETURNS are made when the investable object at hand is not providing a direct flow of cash. This is true for non-dividend (which is the vast majority) stocks, derivatives, physical collectibles like pet rocks/beanie babies/tulip bulbs, and digital collectibles like in-game skins/NFTs/cryptocurrencies, etc. Examples of cash flowing investments would be dividend stocks, direct ownership of small businesses such that net profits are available to you, or rental properties. It is important to note while ultimately supply and demand determine if a price for an investable object goes up over time, the underlying reason an investable object has demand at all can be wildly different from object to object. The reason some people want first edition charizards is usually a very different reason people want to own a stock of a company. It is within the eye of the investor to decide if the reason is a good reason, and hopefully a reason that leads to increased demand in the future.

So, what is a Ponzi? According to ChatGPT, a Ponzi scheme is ‚Äúa fraudulent investment scam that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors. The scheme relies on using the funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than generating legitimate profit from actual investments or business activities. Eventually, the scheme collapses when it becomes impossible to recruit enough new investors or when too many existing investors try to withdraw their money at the same time.‚Äù

That seems like a pretty good definition to me! The part that everyone focuses on when thinking about a Ponzi is this part: ‚Äúthe scheme relies on using funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors.‚Äù This sounds extremely similar to my charizard example, yet I hope you have the intellectual honesty to accept that a real Ponzi scheme is different from buying low and selling high.¬†

The part that is extremely important, in addition to old investor returns being funded by new investors, is that the scheme PROMISES a return. The reality is that many Ponzi schemes do not start off as Ponzi schemes. There are sometimes investment funds that partake briefly in Ponzi-like behavior to paper over potential insolvency during a downturn, and then return to legitimate investment activities when the market improves. Doing this is quite risky and is still illegal, because if you aren‚Äôt able to essentially over deliver (and underpromise) on future returns to even things out, you‚Äôre essentially stuck in an endless cycle of repaying old investors who cash out with newer investor money, turning your once legitimate investment fund into a Ponzi scheme. The right move is to always be open and honest about what returns you‚Äôre able to achieve for your investors to avoid being stuck in the Ponzi-loop I described.¬†

Another attribute of Ponzi schemes is that Ponzi‚Äôs almost always violently collapse once the perceived value of the fund goes down. This is because once a Ponzi stops attracting new money, it becomes apparent very quickly that the liabilities of the fund far outstrip the assets.¬†

**Example 2.** Imagine a hypothetical Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi fund initially accepted $1,000 dollars from 10 eager investors in a local town. The fund manager promises a 10% annual yield so that in 1 year‚Äôs time, any of the original investors can withdraw $1,100, if they so please. Unfortunately, our manager really sucks at operating this Ponzi, and after 1 year, obtains exactly zero new clients. His liabilities at the end of the year are now $11,000, but he only has $10,000 of cash on hand. Even more unfortunately for him, Taylor Swift is announced to be coming to town and tickets are on sale now, and the tickets incidentally cost $1,100. All his investors want to cash out immediately so they ask for their money back. The first 9 that come to him are able to get their money back ($1,100 x 9 = $9,900). When the 10th person comes back, he realizes there‚Äôs only $100 for him, not the $1,100 he was promised! The fund not only has basically no money left, it owes $1000. The 10th person notifies the police, and our unfortunate fund manager is arrested for fraud.¬†

I will note that in this example, this scheme required 90% of the investors to withdraw for the scheme to collapse, but examples in history tend to be much more skewed, where even a small withdrawal of 1-5% of investors can completely collapse the scheme.

Returning to the investable object definition, once a Ponzi runs out of new investors to pay prior investors, the investable object completely disappears because the fund you thought was flush with desirable investable objects (that could be sold on an open market for hopefully higher than you originally paid for) actually had a negative cash balance the entire time! Behind the curtain, there actually was no object at all. This is in contrast to our buy low sell high example with the charizard card. The charizard market could hypothetically collapse tomorrow such that the market price drops from $10,000 to $1. Maybe everyone collectively realizes Pokemon is super lame, and that Yugioh is the superior card game. At the end of the day, there are two truths: you still own the investable object aka the charizard, and no one promised you a return for owning it. You can always wait it out, hoping that people become interested in charizards (and Pokemon) again.¬†

I hope this somewhat lengthy piece was helpful in elucidating Ponzi schemes for anyone that read this far. I often see CLEARLY non-Ponzi investable objects being echo-chambered as Ponzi‚Äôs on Reddit, when it really stems from a misunderstanding of the investable object, or the mechanics of investment itself. If your investable object trades on an open market, and nominal gains are made through price increases due to supply and demand dynamics, it is almost certainly not a Ponzi. If nobody is promising you a return, it also probably isn‚Äôt a Ponzi. This does not mean your investable object itself is not a scam or a bubble. That determination should be made with your best judgment of the fundamentals that underlie the object itself. I will leave you with 2 final examples to illustrate this.¬†

**Example 3.** Tesla stock is neither a Ponzi (trades on open market) nor a scam (they actually sell cars, batteries, etc for a profit). It might be a bubble if you think the company‚Äôs market cap is too high for what its future profits will be.

**Example 4.** Nikola stock is not a Ponzi (stock traded on open market), but it was a scam. The CEO lied to investors about how functional the cars were (they weren‚Äôt), and how many they sold (pretty much zero).",2024-12-17 00:24:17,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfy0q8/ponzi_spotting_a_laymens_guide_to_differentiating/
1hfs25j,"Reminder: If You Trade More, Wall Street Makes More Money","I've spent a few years reading Warren Buffett and other value investors. Essentially what I learned is that they make money by other people pushing prices too high or too low. Especially when prices become too low, they swoop in and buy a bunch. Next they sit on it a few years until the price goes to the correct valuation again, or preferably after many years when the company deteriorates.

Time and time again, people have predicted that Buffett's strategy will eventually stop working. We nowadays can learn much more etc etc.

Yet, stock prices are all over the place. Tesla doubled in the last 3 months for example. How is that possible? How can a 1T dollar company double in value in 3 months? They still build the same stuff with roughly the same people. Similar for Bitcoin. Also almost doubled in a few months. If that was inevitable according to some metric, then why was it not priced in?

At the same time, there is a common sentiment online that the world is becoming more and more unequal. More wealth accumulates in the hands of a few people.

So let me say this: if you are currently considering buying into some stock that went up recently, please let me remind you that there is only one party that will always make money from your trade. It's not you. It's your broker/Wall Street. They don't care whether you make money or lose money. Some will slam ""price targets"" on stocks if that makes you trade. Some will call other stocks ""uninvestible"" if that makes you trade.",2024-12-16 20:02:39,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfs25j/reminder_if_you_trade_more_wall_street_makes_more/
1hfr8dz,Achieved my first milestone after 3 years!,"After 3 years of investing, I've finally achieved my goal of investing my first $100,000! This was a challenge I gave myself after hearing Warren Buffet say you should strive to invest 100k into the market. *(I know that by now it's inflated to likely be the equivalent of 300k, but that's my next goal.)*

I did this by living with my parents and paying low but fair rent, finding a decent job that pays 75k-80k a year, avoiding fast food where possible, and just being frugal in general. 

**Investment strategy:**

1. investing $10 every business day into both VOO and VOOG. *(roughly $400 a month)*  
2. investing in Tesla when Tesla is low. *(this is 20% of my portfolio. My largest position.)*  
3. keeping my ear to the ground, and capitalizing on things like meta's stock devaluing. *(Though, I totally missed Nvidia sadly.)*  
4. diversifying into other promising tech companies, such as Microsoft and Google. *(less than fruitful, but it's still diversified.)*

I think the riskiest strategy has been in Tesla. In the past, it's been difficult watching the stock go up and down, but I had faith in their business practices and ethics. Now Tesla is popping off, and given Elon's position with Trump, this should give room for Tesla to continue its growth. Sadly, because of that, I can't view Tesla as much as an ethical company as much as I could in the past, but that won't diminish it's ability to grow and I see the stock continuing to rise in the future.

**Looking forward:**

Since Tesla isn't going to be low for some time, one thing I want to invest in going forward is in clean power companies, such as nuclear for AI companies. So I'll continue looking into that for future paychecks to go to. Any recommendations are welcome!

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):**¬†\+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):**¬†\+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after¬†dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is¬†**73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a¬†[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).¬†**TL;DR:**

>‚Äú‚Ä¶AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn‚Äôt make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it‚Äôs the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what‚Äôs coming thanks to NVIDIA‚Äôs CUDA (moat), among¬†[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).‚Äù

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is¬†[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)¬†and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software¬†easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of AI‚Äôs opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)¬†I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I‚Äôm still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024).

1hcqtr1,Returning to active stock portfolio management,"I recently decided to return to active stock portfolio management after my first attempt ended somewhat disastrously. To reconcile this experience and entertain others, I want to reflect on the mistakes I made and the new approaches I‚Äôve adopted.

But first, briefly, the story of my initial failure.

When I started managing my portfolio, I quickly learned about the S&P 500 but was convinced I was smart enough to outperform the market. Arrogance was one of the main reasons for my downfall.

In 2019, I flirted with Bitcoin, which initially delivered great returns. Encouraged by the hype, I also invested heavily in PaySafe shortly after its IPO, believing in its potential because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù said it was going to be great. At the same time, I was doing a lot of day trading. Looking back, I realize I wasn‚Äôt trading rationally. I‚Äôd look at graphs and invest simply because I felt the price would go up. I was taking desirable outcomes for granted.

Although I made a few conservative and reasonable investments, their success couldn‚Äôt offset the losses caused by Bitcoin‚Äôs decline, PaySafe‚Äôs terrible performance, and my risky trading. After 18 months, my portfolio was down 40%.

The arrogance I started with made the loss feel devastating. I abandoned my investment account for several years.

When I returned to it a year ago, I discovered that the growth of my conservative investments, along with Bitcoin‚Äôs recovery, had boosted my portfolio to 20% growth from my initial investment. I sold everything and bought into the S&P 500, feeling that I wasn‚Äôt capable of picking good stocks and should leave that to the fund. This turned out to be a good action, as the S&P 500 performed very well this year.

Now, I feel I‚Äôve learned from my mistakes and am ready to approach active investing again. 

To avoid repeating the same mistakes, I‚Äôve set specific rules to guide me:

1. I Avoid Speculative Investments
I now steer clear of speculative assets like crypto, IPO stocks, or companies like Tesla. I want to be a disciplined investor, keeping my greed under control.  

2. I Reject Market Timing
I no longer believe in timing the market but instead focus on time in the market. I avoid trying to ‚Äúbuy low today and sell high tomorrow‚Äù because it‚Äôs too easy to confuse wishful thinking with reality. Paying attention to micro events can help to take advantage of daily fluctuations, but it requires too much time and still, offers uncertain outcomes. More often than not, it doesn‚Äôt pay off.

3. Focus on Debt-to-Equity
In the past, I ignored the debt-to-equity ratio. Now, I prioritize companies with consistent net income and manageable debt levels.

4. Limit Individual Stock Exposure
I cap my individual stock picks at 5% of my total portfolio. Previously, this rule would have forced me to find 20 or more stocks to invest in, leading to choosing assets that were just ‚Äúokay‚Äù rather than ones I genuinely liked. Thankfully, with most of my portfolio now in the S&P 500, individual stock picks act as a good supplement rather than a replacement for the index.

5. Invest in Goods and Services I Value
My approach to stock selection has shifted. I now look for companies whose products and services I personally interact with and consider them of great value. If the companies also demonstrate strong financial performance and maintain a reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, they become my choice.

I hope these rules will help me sleep well at night, keep me from obsessing over financial news, and generate decent returns that complement the S&P 500.",2024-12-12 17:51:03,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hcqtr1/returning_to_active_stock_portfolio_management/

1h9i57c,"I'm bullish on Rivian, and here is why.","Currently holding 65 shares, looking to round that out to 100 next pay period.  I am not a financial advisor, and this is not investment advice. I am simply sharing my thoughts. 

These are the things I will be watching this year, to continue to add to my position, or to see if I should reconsider my bullish sentiment. 

1. Nearing profitability.  Rivian has recently re-affirmed that by Q4 2024 we will be seeing gross profit per vehicle. They are expected to deliver just over 50,000 vehicles for the year. That is a combination of mostly R1S and R1T with some of the Amazon delivery vans. If there guidance is correct, and they either meet or beat q4 '24 earnings, it is a bullish sign.

  
2. $6 Billion loan from Uncle Sam. Now the new administration does create a bit of tension here.  The new ""DOGE"" agency is going to be cutting Gov. spending across the board. There is some concern they will take away this loan that the Biden administration had given to Rivian. While this is certainly a possibility, I do not think it is going to happen. I think it would be a very bad look politically, and would give strength to the argument musk will us his Gov. connections to attack his competitors. Because of that, I think this money is safely staying with Rivian.  If it turns out DOGE is going to back down from this threat, that is another bullish sign.

  
3. VW Rivian joint venture. VW NA is about to change, they are getting a new CEO, Kjell Gruner, who previously was the President and CEO of Porsche Cars of North America and then moved to Rivian to be there ""Chief Commercial Officer & President, Business Growth"".  VW desperatley needs software expertise, and Rivian delivers that in spades. That combined with VWs massive buying and production power, is a strong match. This is a bullish sign right now, and what I think has been pushing to stock upwards. 

VW has been hurting and their reputation is in the pits.  The introduction of the old/new Scout brand, that looks mighty similar to Rivians R2 concepts. As well as confirming the deal with Rivian, it looks like they're finally going to start to take serious steps to rebuilding their reputation, especially in NA. 

  
4. Rivians customers are happy, and according to a recent Consumer Reports Survey, 86% of owners say they would buy a Rivian again, better than Tesla. If they are happy with their purchase, they will talk to their other wealthy friends about their Rivian, word of mouth is very powerful.

  
5. The inevitable Tesla Comparison. RIVIAN IS NOT TESLA. Now obviously Tesla the company in 2024 is very different to Tesla the company in 2015. Back in 2015 it was the 3rd year of Model S production and the first of Model X. 

in 2015 Tesla sold just over 50,000 Model S. Now in 2023, just two years after the Rivian R1T debuted, Rivian sold just over 47,000 vehicles. I think Tesla in 2015 is more of a fair comparison to Rivian now in 2024, but Tesla now in 2024 is not so comparable to Rivian now in 2024.

  
I think Rivian makes a fantastic product, and there's a bright future ahead for them.",2024-12-08 12:47:50,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h9i57c/im_bullish_on_rivian_and_here_is_why/
1h4063m,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

1h3z7qg,Thoughts on Tesla in December,"So right after Tesla recently reached it's ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it's current correction.

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

1h2syee,Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born,"Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

1h28t5b,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

1h2886i,the TRUTH about investing no one tells you,"# 1. The system is rigged

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there‚Äôs **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who‚Äôs really winning here? Hint: it‚Äôs not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn‚Äôt about being the smartest‚Äîit‚Äôs about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here‚Äôs your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it‚Äôs easy to find the next Tesla? It‚Äôs not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can‚Äôt value the stock, you can‚Äôt invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can‚Äôt invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it‚Äôs incredibly hard‚Äîthink Charlie Munger-level hard.**

  
**What this all means**

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt win.The winners aren‚Äôt the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""‚Äîthey‚Äôre the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

1gtiief,I‚Äôve got around $200k in an Inherited IRA (account must be closed and taxes paid within 10 years) Looking to put about half in a Trump-Friendly portfolio. Companies that will likely do very well under his administration. Is anybody doing the same?,"More context:  $100k is currently in S&P , the other $100k I would like to invest very aggressively with companies ran by trumps friends/ businesses that align with his economic policies.

I‚Äôm 31 years old and inherited this money 6 months ago. It had been earning 5% up until the election, now I‚Äôm looking to ride the Trump train and with an aggressive portfolio I believe a fair expectation/hope is to get this 200k to 500k by the end of trumps 4 years.

These are some companies I‚Äôm thinking so far, I appreciate any insight or suggestions for other sectors/stocks 

-Tesla and other Battery/mining related companies Tesla uses?
-UFC/Endeavor/WWE/ZUFA (Dana white companies) (don‚Äôt remember the exact parent company ticker) 
-US Automotive (Stellantis for expample I think could make a nice comeback) 
-US Oil / Fracking companies?
-Nvidia 
-AI
-Netflix, Spotify

These are just some off the top of my head, I appreciate any and all constructive criticism and recommendations.

I am by no means an expert, but I do have a well paying salary (about 6 figures)   BTC, 100k in S&P ,  so I‚Äôm not putting all my eggs in one basket here.

1gmpzpr,"Creating a Python library for Mandelbrot's metrics, doubts with Hurst Exponent/Scale","Sorry if I am off-topic, I am new to this world and to get feedback I had to start somewhere (send me to the proper subreddit if I'm wrong).

I have just finished reading The Misbehaviour of Markets by Mandelbrot, and I immediately started looking for libraries in Python to do data analysis using his suggested metrics.

To my surprise, I couldn't find any. So, first question, did I not search properly? What do you use?

Therefore, I started developing mine :)  
But I am having problems with the Hurst exponent/scalability (it is utilized to evaluate the extent of long-term reliance in market predictability), I don't understand how to interpret the results or there is a bug in the code (less likely, or in the data).

[https://github.com/packmad/Riskstats](https://github.com/packmad/Riskstats)

I am posting here the results of some well known assets, ordered by the exponent:

|ticker|name|hurst\_scale\_factor|hurst\_exponent|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|NVDA|NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)|0.0583817|1.37871|

I have a high exposure to AAPL and it has served me well. With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost, I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. 

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

1gh1z43,Need help regarding intrinsic value ,"So the stock in question is Tesla.

I have done lots of research into the company and it‚Äôs finances and have used multiple methods in order to determine an intrinsic value (including margin of safety) to find a nice entry price. The methods I have used are:

1) Discounted cash flow ($50.49)
2) Multiples valuation model ($31.81)
3) Graham‚Äôs valuation model ($179.41)

This is not to say that my valuations are correct by any means, and I accept there could be faults in my calculations. My concern is that Grahams valuation model has produced the highest IV by some margin. However, it seems quite reasonable given how Tesla stock has traded over the last few years that this could be fairly accurate. I just want some advice on how people would use these numbers. Would you:

A- Use grahams alone as a benchmark for IV

B- Try and find an average between all 3 models and use that as an IV value ($81 would be the average), but at the risk that the stock may never drop as low as this so I may miss out on the stock altogether 

Edit- Please offer your advice, I am trying my best to learn and would be handy to see what other people do in this situation ",2024-11-01 10:09:44,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gh1z43/need_help_regarding_intrinsic_value/

I‚Äôve been hip to investing for a few years now, loading up $50 here and there in companies like Tesla, Nike, Apple‚Ä¶ you know the big companies. 

But I had several realizations as I‚Äôve been continuously studying investing.

1. I DONT KNOW WHAT I AM DOING! $50 here and there into the companies I named is BS. I learned just because a company is in the news often doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they have good financials (they turn a profit, steady growth, etc) 

2. NO STRUCTURE: $50 here and there is NO structure what so ever. I want to get to a place where I can invest $250 EVERY MONTH (I‚Äôll work my way up as my income increases) not just 3 or 7 months the year but 12 months. I want investing to be apart of my monthly budget and I‚Äôm serious about that expense just like I am my rent / car note. 

3. NO STRUCTURE (Continued): there‚Äôs no portfolio management, I don‚Äôt have a solid investment strategy.

So in a nut shell, I‚Äôm investing all wrong. I‚Äôm proud of my self for taking the steps to invest because majority of my blood line doesn‚Äôt invest but I am one of the ones that isn‚Äôt scared, I want to seek out the necessary information, and I want to apply it. 

So that being me to my questions.

‚Ä¢ how do I find a solid investment advisor/ CFA? 
‚Ä¢ what exactly do I look for? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some bullshit advisors out there and I want to make SURE I don‚Äôt run into one. My generational wealth depends on the quality of my advisor. I‚Äôm just not sure how to do due diligence to even find the right person. This is way out of my arena. 

If anyone can offer advice, insight, recommendations, it would be much Appreciated.

This topic stresses me out so much because what if I really pick a sh!tty advisor and I don‚Äôt reap the benefits I want in my retirement.

1e4f88h,"1 Is there a process by which info about a stock goes from insider knowledge to widespread knowledge, and how that relates to bubbles?","Warren Buffet once said something like 'be greedy when others are fearful, be fearful when others are greedy'

There is also the shoeshine boy effect of Joe Kennedy. Supposedly when Joe Kennedy started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, that is when he knew it was time to leave the market. Supposedly he just made this story up to cover for insider trading, but its still a good lesson.

I feel like a stock goes through certain steps. At each step the potential gain goes down while the potential losses go up. Is there a name for this process?

FWIW my money is in index funds, so I don't really know a lot about the psychology of the stock market.

But it would go something like this

- step one. Only insiders who work in the industry have specialized knowledge and they can use that knowledge to buy low. This would be examples of insider trading (which is illegal) or politicians like Nancy Pelosi buying stocks based on confidential government information about government policy related to publicly traded companies (which is legal, but should be illegal).

- Knowledge that is public, but is very esoteric and hidden. There is knowledge out there about a new technology, new policy, etc that will affect the stocks price but the only people that know about it are experts in the field. Its public knowledge, but only a handful of experts know the info.

- Knowledge that is public and fairly well known. Basically anyone with google can find the knowledge.

- Knowledge that is mainstream. The mainstream media reports on the knowledge.

- Knowledge that causes hype. I guess an example of this would be NVIDIA or Tesla. After a while there was massive hype in these companies, and the stock prices didn't reflect their P/E ratios. At this point the general public who have no knowledge of stocks jumps on the bandwagon and ends up losing money when the stock crashes. NVIDIA hasn't crashed, but it might. 

With each step, the knowledge of the stock becomes more public and the less informed the investors become. 

Its not a perfect system by any means. Bitcoin went through the last phase of the general public jumping on the bandwagon and crashed in 2021, but it recovered from the crash and is now worth more than it was in 2020. However bitcoin only went above its 2021 peak in the last few months. Bitcoin peaked at 61k in October of 2021, crashed, and only went back up to 62k in June of 2024.

But stocks like Tesla did drop after they became mainstream 'good ideas' to buy for uninformed investors.

1dulktf,Tesla Set for a New Bull Run as Deliveries Turn Around and Energy Storage Powers the AI Era,"Whenever investors are disappointed with Tesla, Elon Musk surprises short sellers with a big move. On Tuesday, Tesla posted stronger-than-expected Q2 deliveries, hinting at a turning point for weak demand, with an upside in Q3 deliveries. Additionally, energy storage deployments doubled quarter-over-quarter, potentially helping to meet the vast electricity demand that comes with AI. These factors are enough to bring in a substantial influx of Tesla bulls.

Thanks to these developments, Tesla surged over 10% on Tuesday, with its market value reaching $737.5 billion, maintaining a six-day rally, and breaking another resistance level, which is always a bullish sign. From April's low, Tesla shares are now up 67%.

**Q2 Deliveries Slightly Exceed Expectations Amid Record June Deliveries from Chinese EV Makers, Zero-Interest Car Purchases Expected to Drive Crazy Q3 Demand**

According to Tesla's delivery data released on Tuesday, the company delivered 440,000 new vehicles in Q2, down 4.8% year-over-year but up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and better than the market's expectation of 439,300 vehicles. The total production in Q2 was about 411,000 cars, resulting in a delivery-production gap of 33,000 cars, compared to -46,000 cars in the previous quarter (where more cars were produced, leading to some inventory remaining). Tesla noted that sales in the second quarter were affected by the temporary shutdown of German factories and the Red Sea conflict, which also means there is upward potential on the demand side or perhaps short-term supply struggles to meet demand, which is obviously more exciting than excess supply.

Considering that Chinese EV makers such as NIO, ZEEKR, and Leapmotor have all reported record deliveries in June, this implies a significant recovery in demand for Tesla. The company also launched a major campaign on Monday, introducing five-year zero interest financing for Model 3/Y and other preferential policies.

Specifically, users who place an order before and including July 31 can avail themselves of a no-down-payment deal: with an initial down payment of 79,900 yuan (10,990 dollars), the daily installment for the Model 3 RWD and Long Range AWD will be as low as 85 yuan and 107 yuan respectively (12 and 15 dollars for each), while the Model Y RWD and Long Range will be as low as 95 yuan and 118 yuan per day. Users who make a down payment of 45,900 yuan (6,300 dollars) can opt for a five-year low-interest plan (starting at an annualized rate of 0.93%).

The Chinese market accounts for about 22.5% of Tesla's revenue, and if this measure is implemented in other countries in the future, it would indeed be a massive move. This also adds a new narrative for Tesla's Q3 growth.

**Energy Storage Deployment Doubles, Benefitting from AI Era**

Both NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have pointed out that the future development of artificial intelligence is closely related to energy and storage. While Tesla's AI business has yet to show tangible benefits, its energy storage business is poised to become a pillar of AI in the future.

Tesla reported that it deployed 9.4 GWh of energy storage products in Q2, setting a new record for quarterly deployment, more than double the 4 GWh in Q1, and the company's energy storage deployments in the first half of the year almost matched the total for last year.

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas praised, ""As Gen AI acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy, which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business is uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the U.S. electric grid accelerated by the AI boom.""",2024-07-03 18:30:33,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dulktf/tesla_set_for_a_new_bull_run_as_deliveries_turn/
1dtwxpy,Diversify once you hit a gain % threshold?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm 25M and have been putting all my spare money after expenses into the stock market. I only had to pay half of my college so that was really helpful but I‚Äôve been working a lot of jobs and internships since 16 which helped too.

So I started investing 7 years ago and have seen an annualized return of 16.1%. I bought Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, and others in the first couple years and have seen incredible returns from them. 

My question is if you would recommend I diversify any of my gains. For example I put 1k into Nvidia and now it‚Äôs around 10k. But now my stock portfolio is not that diversified because of some large gains between a few stocks I have are holding all the weight.

1dj6opn,Selling NVDA with $1m gains,"I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to sell a portion of my Nvidia stock once I hit $1million profit. As of close today, I need an additional 22% increase to hit this threshold so it will likely happen before the end of the month or by the end of summer if things slow down/correct.    

A little back story, I bought my first shares in Feb  2017 for $2.77 and again in October for $4.86.  I‚Äôve continued to buy big chunks of it over the last 7 years because I thought GPUs would be needed for self driving cars.  Little did I know the Ai boom and to a smaller extent crypto would help Nvidia catapult to now the largest company in the world.  

My total cost basis is $34k and I‚Äôm sitting right around $850k.  Gains are around 2600% which is insane.  

I still have more conviction that Ai is a bigger global threat than crypto so I‚Äôm a bit torn on actually selling any of it.  If I sold all the other years people told me Nvidia had mooned, well I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting on the gains I have today.  My gut is telling me to only sell 1/3 of my holding but I have no idea where else to rotate this into.  I‚Äôm also in a unique tax situation where all my gains on this trade are locked into 0% which makes it tempting to let it ride for another year or two for a true FATfire setup.  As with any compounding interest, once the snowball gets to this point, smaller 2-5% moves really move the needle (in both directions).  

Anyways, just want to share this with someone since I can‚Äôt really mention this to most of my friends without it affecting our relationship.  It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs real guess what will happen with Nvidia in the future so I can‚Äôt imagine anyone can persuade me one way or another on this trade.  I‚Äôve experienced similar gains on Tesla but failed to sell at the top and now only have a portion of my gains on that stock so I know when a bubble feels like a bubble and this is definitely in that territory now.

1dbiohg,Why is there such risk aversion?  98% VOO +2% high-risk outperforms with minimal risk or volatility?  (Genuine question!),"I don't know if it's the bubbles I'm in or what social media feeds me, but it seems like everyone is either a high-stakes crypto/AI gambler, or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever.

I haven't used the particular tracker before, but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high-risk plays for a two percent allocation (Bitcoin and Tesla).  I think there's no denying these were highly volatile and highly-valued.  But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio.

But the returns were several percent better than VOO/SPDR.  And a 98% VOO +2% high-risk also outperforms BrkB, while being significantly more diversified.

I think anyone who's trying to ""play it safe"" would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3% by only risking 2% of their allocation.

(I haven't tried it but suspect you could have a portfolio of 70% bonds 30% high-risk and do well with a capped drawdown).

I only ask this question over here in this sub because I wanna hear the community's thoughts. 

As it stands, Tesla has a total shares outstanding of 3.189 Billion. Something along those lines.

1d8tzac,Musk/Tesla Insider trading question,"\*\*I am not promoting Tesla in any way. Reddit wouldn't give me any other flair options besides NSFW. Sorry.

Thanks to anyone who replies. I saw that Musk is apparently under fire for offloading $7.5B of stock (I think in 2022) during a time when he knew that the company wouldn't meet its targets. He also assured investors that it would be a great end to the year, despite knowing the opposite and selling stock.

I'm somewhat ignorant of the legal specifics, and I'm more curious about that than the actual Musk situation. I know insider trading is illegal, but if you're a CEO or other exec and you know your stock is about to take a hit, are you legally required to maintain your position and take the same proportional losses as any other investor?

Also, to avoid getting caught, why don't CEOs allow themselves to take very minor losses and then sell? I'm not advocating that, I'm just genuinely curious. It seems like a sketchy choice to sell so much stock without incurring losses when losses are incurred by others so shortly after. If a CEO rides a loss for just a little bit and **then** sells before everyone else (who lacks the CEO's insider knowledge) is that still insider trading?

  
Edit: On a scale of 1 (Rather Questionable) to 10 (Boldfaced Securities Fraud), how would you rank this situation? People seem to have mixed opinions. ",2024-06-05 16:20:34,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d8tzac/musktesla_insider_trading_question/

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I‚Äôm still well within the ‚Äòmaybe I‚Äôm just lucky‚Äô phase since it‚Äôs only been a couple years, but I‚Äôve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past:¬†

1. Insight¬†
2. Conviction¬†
3. Patience

**Insight**

I‚Äôve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).¬†

Ben Graham‚Äôs quote rings true:¬†

>‚ÄúIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.‚Äù

Perhaps counterintuitively, I‚Äôve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.¬†

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.¬†

# Math

In 2023 I also started¬†practicing math daily¬†(243 days straight¬†as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I‚Äôd done any meaningful math.¬†

I‚Äôm not sure how much, but it¬†*feels*¬†like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.¬†

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.¬†

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.¬†

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I‚Äôve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I‚Äôm not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I‚Äôm happy I did.¬†

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.¬†

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,¬†you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I‚Äôm much more patient in my investing these days and don‚Äôt react to the day-to-day.¬†

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I don‚Äôt make another trade for the rest of 2024.

**UPDATE:**

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

I opened my portfolio in June 2022. Since then the cumulative S&P return is \~28% (\~39% for Nasdaq). My cumulative return for that same period is around \~215%.

1cnicsr,NIO's Strategic Charge in the Global EV Market,"Investing in NIO, despite its current operational losses and significant debt levels, can be considered a forward-looking strategy, particularly for those who are bullish on the future of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable technologies. 

NIO's debt is largely a reflection of its aggressive investment in research and development, infrastructure, and expanding production capabilities. These investments are critical for gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market. By financing growth and innovation, NIO is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the global EV market, which is expected to grow substantially.  NIO is not just focusing on the Chinese market but is also eyeing expansion into Europe and potentially other international markets, giving it more growth opportunities.

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from fossil fuels to electric and hybrid vehicles. This shift is expected to continue due to the decreasing cost of batteries, improved EV infrastructure, and increasing societal awareness about climate change.

However the journey to other countries such as America does not come without challenges, especially with the  giant EV manufacturer Tesla running the show. Tesla has a strong brand presence in the U.S., recognized for pioneering the electric car industry and backed by high-profile CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's brand is associated with innovation, quality, and sustainability, aspects that resonate well with American consumers. NIO, while a recognized brand in China and some parts of Europe, would need marketing efforts to establish similar recognition in the U.S.  For NIO to compete effectively, it will need to differentiate its vehicles through unique features, possibly focusing on its innovative Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, advanced autonomous driving capabilities, and superior interior luxury, which are some of NIO's strong suits.

Tesla's extensive Supercharger network provides a significant competitive edge in the U.S., where infrastructure is a critical factor for EV adoption. NIO would need to either build its own charging infrastructure, form alliances with existing networks, or innovate around this challenge, perhaps by emphasizing its battery swap technology, which provides a full battery charge in a matter of minutes as opposed to longer charging times at a typical EV station.

Navigating the U.S. regulatory environment can be challenging, particularly for a foreign company amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over trade and technology transfer. NIO will need to manage these aspects carefully, ensuring compliance with U.S. regulations and possibly facing higher tariffs or trade barriers that could affect pricing and competitiveness.

1jgkamz,TSLA Fair Value Analysis: The bull The Bear . The case for the 140 and 180 Valuation,"

TL;DR: Tesla is significantly overvalued at current levels ($240). Fair value range $140-180 based on deteriorating growth metrics, declining margins, and elevated valuation multiples. Current prices require near-perfect execution on unproven future tech bets.

---

I've been watching the Tesla story unfold for years, and recent developments demand a sober reassessment of the stock's fair value. After diving into the latest financials and operational metrics, I believe the market is significantly overestimating Tesla's near-term prospects.

Current Market Sentiment vs. Financial Reality

While Wall Street maintains an average price target around $310-340, I see a serious disconnect with Tesla's financial performance:

Stagnant Growth: 2024 revenue grew a meager 0.95% YoY, with the company posting its first-ever annual delivery decline
Margin Compression: Q4 operating margin fell to 6.2%, down from 8.2% a year earlier, as Tesla sacrifices profitability for volume
Valuation Stretch: Currently trading at 161x P/E - astronomical even for a growth company, especially one showing signs of maturation

The Cybertruck Debacle: Canary in the Coal Mine

The Cybertruck situation isn't just about recalls or insurance challenges - it exposes fundamental issues with Tesla's execution:

* Production challenges with new materials and manufacturing techniques
* Price points that severely limit market potential (originally pitched as a mass-market vehicle)
* Sales volumes falling dramatically short of projections (40K annually vs. Musk's 250K target)

Why $140-180 is Fair Value

A 40-50% downside from current levels might seem extreme, but consider:

1. Rational Multiples: A 50-75x P/E would still be generous for a company with stalled growth and margin pressure. This alone justifies significant contraction.

2. Auto Industry Fundamentals: Legacy automakers typically trade at 5-15x earnings. Even with Tesla's energy business and software potential, a 100% premium to industry leaders feels more appropriate than the current 1000%+ premium.

3. Valuation Models Agree: Discounted cash flow analyses consistently show fair value around $150, with some sophisticated models suggesting even lower targets.

## Profiting From This View

Options for bulls(No not Caesars legion)  :
* Reduce position sizes to limit exposure
* Sell covered calls to generate income while holding core positions
* Focus on defined-risk options strategies rather than outright stock ownership

For bears (No not the NCR ):
* Consider put spreads 6+ months out to avoid short-term volatility
* Focus on strike prices in the $180-200 range for optimal risk/reward

For neutral investors(Finally I escape the FNV brain rot ) :
* Wait for better entry points in the $140-180 range
* Use cash-secured puts at those levels to potentially acquire shares at even better prices

Risk Factors To My Thesis

I acknowledge several potential upside catalysts:

* The affordable model (expected H1 2025) could exceed volume expectations
* FSD/robotaxi progress could accelerate more quickly than anticipated
* Trump administration policies could benefit Tesla's competitiveness
* Energy storage business could see inflection point in growth/margins

## Bottom Line

The market is pricing Tesla as if every ambitious future project will succeed perfectly. History shows that even the most visionary companies encounter delays, setbacks, and execution challenges. A fair valuation needs to account for these risks.

At $140-180, Tesla would still command a premium valuation that respects its innovation potential while acknowledging the very real headwinds it faces in 2025-2026.

1j4b2bx,How to remove exposure to an index component,"We seem to be getting a lot of the same question recently about how to remove exposure of an index component if someone holds an index fund.

Whether it's NVDIA because you think there's an AI bust coming. Or you don't want to own TSLA because of Musk - there are ways to remove exposure of a component in an index.

First - the easiest way to do that is to not hold that fund and find a different fund that fits your criteria.

But if you want to hold certain types of indices such as large cap indices but you want to exclude a large cap component - it is a bit more difficult.

These are the different ways from most complicated to simplest.

1. Roll synthetic short futures with equivalent negative delta.
2. Write equivalent negative delta using deep otm call credit spreads or naked calls.
3. Short the equivalent dollar amount of shares
4. Roll long short puts or put debit spreads.
5. If an inverse ETP exists, buy the dollar equivalent of the inverse ETP.
6. Use a model-based replication service (usually only avail through an SMA/UMA program) which supports trade restrictions.
7. Use a direct index solution which supports rebalancing. 

Some of these solutions require more trading effort and derivatives experience than the average investor. So unless you are familiar - don't do it. And it's not possible to use some of these techniques in retirement accounts.

For most investors - the simplest is #6 or #7. Many brokers offer direct indexing and/or managed accounts - for example:

Schwab stock slices - [https://www.schwab.com/fractional-shares-stock-slices](https://www.schwab.com/fractional-shares-stock-slices)

There are probably more ways - but these are the techniques of top of mind. And if anyone cares - I normally use technique #2.",2025-03-05 19:08:38,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1j4b2bx/how_to_remove_exposure_to_an_index_component/

1izkzc2,"Curious about TSLA and co-mingling with SpaceX, Twitter, and Starlink","Musk's empire appears to be built primarily on the value of Tesla stock which has a P/E ratio of about 140 vs the more common 7-ish range.  If Tesla was valued similarly to other car manufacturers, the stock price would be around $15/share instead of today's prices in the $285 range or a peak value of around $480.

And part of that appears to be because Tesla continues to produce EVs even though they are not selling to get the carbon credits they then sell to other automakers.

All that said, he regularly [co-mingles assets](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/elon-musk-told-nvidia-to-ship-ai-chips-reserved-for-tesla-to-x-xai.html) and [personnel between projects](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html).

Even setting aside such items, since he uses the TSLA stock to leverage nearly all his other ventures, doing things like [buying Twitter and turning it into a more extremist site](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/elon-musk-x-twitter-antisemitism-hashtags-trending-hate-rcna151945) drove off advertisers, reduced the value of the purchased property, and both directly and indirectly harmed the value of TSLA by driving off both investors and consumers (generally, people who buy EVs are more likely to be left-leaning while the racists tend to prefer gas guzzlers).

On top of all this, he has a [history ](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/24/musks-twitter-has-been-sued-by-at-least-six-companies-for-unpaid-bills.html)of [not paying his bills](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/wiwynn-sues-elon-musks-xtwitter-over-unpaid-server-bills/#:~:text=Hyperscale%20server%20maker%20Wiwynn%20is,and%20is%20seeking%20%2461m).  And has been sued for trying to manipulate stock prices [through outrageous claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-sec-lawsuit-twitter-d2640adc) and [non-disclosure](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/musk-sued-by-twitter-investors-delayed-disclosure-stake-2022-05-26/).

With recent TSLA value drops, there have been recent rumors (not linking/promoting these -- you can find the videos on YouTube, Insta, and TT if you want) that his recent activities are driving down the price and that he may try to saddle all his debt on TSLA then spin up IPOs for SpaceX and/or Starlink.

I already sold off my TSLA stock a while back, so I am not seeking personal financial advice.

I'm mostly curious about whether using TSLA to buy/fund these other companies and forcing the other shareholders in TSLA to bear the brunt of his personal decisions could give shareholders a legal interest in those companies.

Would this potentially prevent him from dumping all his debt on TSLA shareholders while starting a couple of IPOs to give himself a fresh start?  I mean, when most companies spin off another entity, there's usually some sort of compensation, right?

1inu9y7,Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?,"I‚Äôm not a Tesla expert, and I‚Äôm sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla‚Äôs stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I‚Äôm struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.

Here‚Äôs a list of what bothers me:

1. **Elon Musk‚Äôs PR Nightmare** ‚Äì It‚Äôs hard to ignore how much Musk‚Äôs public image has deteriorated. Between the ‚ÄúSieg Heil‚Äù incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he‚Äôs lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla‚Äôs brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.

1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** ‚Äì Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that‚Äôs no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.

1. **Declining Profit Margins** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that‚Äôs valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.

1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** ‚Äì The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla‚Äôs next big thing, but it‚Äôs turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it‚Äôs starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.

1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** ‚Äì Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla‚Äôs self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla‚Äôs claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.

1. **Political and Tariff Risks** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there‚Äôs a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.

1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** ‚Äì Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.

1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.

1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** ‚Äì Tesla‚Äôs alignment with Musk‚Äôs political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla‚Äôs market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.

I used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they‚Äôre slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I‚Äôve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.

What do you think? Am I missing something, or is Tesla headed for some rough times ahead?",2025-02-12 16:02:59,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1inu9y7/is_the_tesla_bubble_about_to_pop/

1hvhjnt,Uber: A Great Buying Opportunity In Current Markets,"**Summary**

* Uber‚Äôs stock is currently undervalued due to market fears surrounding autonomous vehicles, but its robust fundamentals and durable business model make it a highly appealing investment.
* Key strengths include an extensive urban mobility database, loyal user base, and diversified sources of revenue.
* While the rise of self-driving technology presents certain risks, Uber‚Äôs strategic alliances, regulatory challenges for competitors, and market dominance ensure it remains well-positioned for sustained growth.
* Even cautious revenue and margin projections suggest considerable upside potential, making Uber an attractive choice with a strong margin of safety.

**The Impact of Market Narratives on Uber's Perception**

Recent announcements have reignited interest in autonomous driving. Tesla (TSLA) revealed plans to launch the Cybercab by 2027, while Google‚Äôs Waymo (GOOGL) announced expansion into Miami. These updates have led to a nearly 10% drop in Uber‚Äôs stock, contributing to a 15% decline over the past month.

This situation is reminiscent of past market narratives that impacted companies like Google and Meta (META). Both experienced temporary valuation drops due to overblown concerns but ultimately delivered strong returns, supported by solid fundamentals and competent management.

Uber continues to showcase impressive operational growth, strong cash flow, and consistent profitability, all while trading at historically low P/E multiples. These attributes, combined with its moat-driven business model, position Uber as a promising portfolio addition.

**Uber's Competitive Moats and the Importance of Strategic Management**

Uber‚Äôs advantages go beyond its network effects. Its unmatched urban mobility database allows for optimized routing, pricing, and seamless connections between users and drivers. Additionally, features like loyalty programs, subscriptions, and brand trust further enhance its competitive position in a sector where reliability and safety are crucial.

Diversification is another critical element in reducing risk. Similar to Google‚Äôs evolution beyond search, Uber has created a multifaceted platform that includes logistics and transportation. Delivery accounted for 30% of revenue in Q3, while freight contributed 11%, generating $1.3 billion despite not yet achieving positive EBITDA margins. These emerging segments have the potential to become significant revenue drivers in the future.

Furthermore, Uber‚Äôs investments in companies like Grab (GRAB) and DiDi (OTCPK:DIDIY) reflect a strategic approach to balancing profitability and competition. These equity stakes act as a form of optionality while demonstrating Uber‚Äôs ability to focus on long-term gains in key regions.

Uber‚Äôs management has shown remarkable capability in adapting to industry changes. Much like Meta‚Äôs successful redirection of investments, Uber is already positioning itself for the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Partnerships with Waymo in Austin and Atlanta exemplify its ability to integrate self-driving technology while retaining its platform leadership.

**Adapting to Regulations and Long-Term Mobility Trends**

The adoption of self-driving vehicles faces significant hurdles, including regulatory and infrastructure challenges, particularly in emerging markets that are critical to Uber‚Äôs business. While major cities like Los Angeles and Miami may adopt autonomous technology sooner, broader implementation is likely to take years, especially in regions such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.

In addition, overarching trends in urban mobility‚Äîincluding cost savings, easing traffic congestion, and the shift from ownership to access‚Äîsupport Uber‚Äôs long-term growth. Although the global ride-hailing market is already substantial, it remains underpenetrated in numerous regions, providing opportunities for continued expansion.

**Uber's Resilience Shines Even in Pessimistic Scenarios**

While autonomous vehicles pose potential risks, competition from local apps and evolving regulations may present more immediate challenges to Uber‚Äôs margins and market share. Nonetheless, analysts project Uber‚Äôs EPS to reach $4 by 2027 and $4.80 by 2028, resulting in P/E multiples of 15x and 12.8x, respectively.

Even under conservative assumptions, Uber‚Äôs revenue could exceed $74 billion by 2030, with margins reaching 11.5%. In a more optimistic outlook, margins of 17% would result in a P/E multiple around 10x, equating to an earnings yield of 10%‚Äîa compelling figure for a leader in a growing market.

Uber‚Äôs forward P/E and free-cash-flow multiples of 21.9x remain attractive given its growth trajectory and low current valuations. With management forecasting strong EBITDA growth and robust free-cash-flow conversion, Uber offers significant upside even if its market valuation remains steady.

**TLDR:** Uber‚Äôs long-term outlook remains favorable despite concerns over disruption from self-driving technology. Its diversified operations, strategic investments, and adaptability effectively mitigate potential risks. At its current valuation, Uber represents a strong investment opportunity with substantial potential for long-term shareholder returns.

1huvcpj,Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested¬†**‚Ç¨10 per week**¬†in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can‚Äôt remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn‚Äôt my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It‚Äôs not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of¬†**‚Ç¨520**¬†throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is¬†**‚Ç¨706.80**, which means a profit of¬†**‚Ç¨186.80**¬†(+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:**¬†Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:**¬†The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:**¬†I didn‚Äôt touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It‚Äôs just my experience‚Äînot right, not wrong‚Äîjust mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

**Discussion**:  
Has anyone else here tried investment ""experiments"" like this? How did it go for you?

1hodyic,How to invest in broad market minus a few stocks?,"Most of my money's in index funds, but there are a few stocks that I don't believe are worth paying for.

I pretty much want an index fund like VOO minus a few stocks such as APPL, TSLA, MSTR (especially TSLA and MSTR). Idealy a financial institution would provide a bunch (500+) check boxes for each compaany (sorted by market cap) where by default it buys the same fraction of each stock.

Essentially I want to create a custom index fund where my custom fund has almost every notable company in the USA or the world. I like being lazy and do not want to buy 500+ stocks ever time I get a paycheck.

From googling around there are services that offer something called ""direct indexing"" but I don't see why buying / selling a market proportional ammount should cost 0.4% / year. I also do not understand why there would need to be ""rebalancing"" since ETFs such as VOO own (throwing out a number) 5% of everything and buy / sell as people buy / sell the ETF.",2024-12-28 20:03:52,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hodyic/how_to_invest_in_broad_market_minus_a_few_stocks/

1hgl6bo,"First time beating the SP500 in 3 years. Also, reached my second goal of half a milli","I started investing in November 2017 and I was doing great during the bull run. Unfortunately everything crashed down in 2021 and I spent 3 years kicking myself thinking I should've just put everything on SPY and forget it. In the last few months I can finally say that my portfolio is beating the index again. At some point during December 2022 my portfolio was -35% while in comparison if I had put it on SPY I would still be positive. This traumatized me a bit and now that I am finally beating the index over the last 7.2 years I have three main thoughts:

1. Is the volatility worth it?  
2. I'm up on some names anything from 200-800% which makes them seem overvalued and makes me hesitate on buying more of those companies  
3. Feels like a 30%+ haircut can happen at any moment and Im just dreading when it comes.

Clpt: 6%  
Abcl: 3%

I think for now im going to either lower my average on the few names im still down or just slightly up and believe strongly like Beam or Meta OR just buy SPY and turn that into Tsla BTC or Pltr only if there is a big correction in those names.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):**¬†\+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):**¬†\+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after¬†dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is¬†**73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a¬†[previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/).¬†**TL;DR:**

>‚Äú‚Ä¶AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn‚Äôt make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it‚Äôs the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what‚Äôs coming thanks to NVIDIA‚Äôs CUDA (moat), among¬†[other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).‚Äù

>\- [1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/), Nov. 2023

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is¬†[founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/)¬†and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software¬†easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we‚Äôve barely scratched the surface of AI‚Äôs opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)¬†I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I‚Äôm still benefiting from.

1h5wads,Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",2024-12-03 19:49:45,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h5wads/investment_advice_rebalancing/
1h4063m,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

1h2syee,Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born,"Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

1gmpzpr,"Creating a Python library for Mandelbrot's metrics, doubts with Hurst Exponent/Scale","Sorry if I am off-topic, I am new to this world and to get feedback I had to start somewhere (send me to the proper subreddit if I'm wrong).

I have just finished reading The Misbehaviour of Markets by Mandelbrot, and I immediately started looking for libraries in Python to do data analysis using his suggested metrics.

To my surprise, I couldn't find any. So, first question, did I not search properly? What do you use?

Therefore, I started developing mine :)  
But I am having problems with the Hurst exponent/scalability (it is utilized to evaluate the extent of long-term reliance in market predictability), I don't understand how to interpret the results or there is a bug in the code (less likely, or in the data).

[https://github.com/packmad/Riskstats](https://github.com/packmad/Riskstats)

I am posting here the results of some well known assets, ordered by the exponent:

1ginwra,The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA,"Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

Thank you.

1.  Move my 401k and Roth into a money market and collect ~4%.  I am not moving the whole thing possibly 25-50%.  I have fidelity and Blackrock so SPAXX and I‚Äôm limited in my 401k to blackrock money market that‚Äôs available.

2.  Move 50%.  25% to money markets 25% to SQQQ.

1g4cmvs,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that¬† diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

1ey1gi0,Next Steps with Rebalance and Growth,"I posted a couple weeks ago seeking some advice on a 3 fund portfolio and bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elrna2/3_fund_portfolio_bond_advice/).  Got lots of great feedback, and now that I have digested it all - I'm looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle.  The gist of it was:

  
*$5M portfolio, heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA (80%) with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*

What I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?

1exblh8,Should I be riskier in my Roth or my normal brokerage?,"I have been researching Roth IRAs as I turn 18  in a few months. I‚Äôve seen conflicting information on investment strategies for your Roth. 

I had originally thought to use the Roth for ‚Äúsafer‚Äù holds like VOO and QQQ but have been seeing some people say to put risk in a Roth and safe in a normal brokerage. I just want to see what you guys do so I can give myself some context to make my own decision.

I already have a normal brokerage that holdd VOO, QQQ, UPRO, NEE, DVN, TSLA, and BITU

I also am very heavy in crypto (85% BTC and 5% ETH), so I am definitely holding a fairly aggressive portfolio for some context. I was thinking holding mostly etfs in my Roth and individual stocks in my brokerage. Let me know what you think of that approach and what yours is",2024-08-21 00:21:19,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1exblh8/should_i_be_riskier_in_my_roth_or_my_normal/

How can I take advantage of the loss?,"I‚Äôm finally realizing my TSLA stock, which I once thought would go through the roof, will not reach my estimated potential. I will sell them before year end along with another dog stock I have held for too long for a combined loss of $40K. 

Most discussions of tax loss or capital gains harvesting would be concerned with what I do with the cash from that sale, but I have a different question. I have NVDA shares which have appreciated $40K, and I have held them for more than a year. Does it make sense to take my profit now in order to have a net-zero transaction?

1elrna2,3 Fund Portfolio / Bond Advice,"I'm 44 years old and have about $5M in my Schwab accounts. Around $1M is in SNAXX money market, taking advantage of the high interest rates, and the rest is in stocks and mutual funds. My largest holdings are in AAPL and TSLA, accounting for about $3M.

I spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I'm ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions (\~$2666/month for my wife and me) from buying stocks to something else. He suggested the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio, which seems like a good fit. I've also been reading about the 3-fund portfolio.

So, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:

1. **Feedback on SIP vs. 3-fund portfolio?**¬†If I go with the 3-fund portfolio, should I stick with the Schwab options listed on the Bogleheads wiki, or is there a better way to choose the funds?
2. **Advice on moving $500K from SNAXX to bonds:**¬†I'm ready to move half of the $1M in SNAXX to bonds in preparation for interest rates coming down, so I can lock in some good returns for the next 5 years. Any recommendations on what I should consider buying?

I've done well so far by just buying stocks, but this is a bit out of my expertise, so I would love some guidance. Thanks!",2024-08-06 20:03:48,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elrna2/3_fund_portfolio_bond_advice/
1ehnkfo,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify possible buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. An idea I had is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far, already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefor I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of several analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

This yielded the following table:

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

1e22yfr,What is biggest risks to Yield Max ETF?,"I trade actively (futures/options) and have different accounts for different reasons (i.e: long term/IRA/401K/day trading/swing trading/YOLO account as well) so my financial literature is relatively well, but I still dont see the biggest risks to yield max ETF, which is selling covered calls and selling cash secured puts on many famous stocks such as TSLA/NVDA

Those have good return, so I have been buying IRA, since taxes wont apply until withdrawal in retirement. 

  
I understand how they will pay out the dividend in theory and actually I use similar strategy in SPY but whats the biggest risk here? 

My best guess is that individual stocks goes to 0, by which Yield Max ETF will go into 0, but it's hard to imagine that NVDA will go to 0 in any time soon, since they are dealing with big tech or big name stocks with good financial statement and pretty much too big to fail business (i.e: DIS/JPM) 

That makes me think there is virtually no risks but apparently, it sounds too good to be true, and I am getting cautious. Are there anything I should know on this kind of ETFs?

1dpbvd3,Safe starting plan to get into Futures? As well as what to do with my ROTH? ,"Hello all, I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in, and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old.

Firstly, for some background, I started trading maybe back in 2022, I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL, TSLA, LMT, etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck, these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes, I know not to take advice from TikTok lol.

Fast forward to now, I havent touched the account since then, and opening it I have made a return of about 16% with about $400 in total open P&L. Which I feel like is good? maybe? I don't know.

Anyways the reason I'm making this post is because I'm interested in short term profits, I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling, and so it's always been a ""I'll learn how to get into it later"", but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works, and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it:

1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm? Especially if I am just starting out/don't have a trading strategy? Or would I be better off starting with micros & my own money?
2. On that note, how do I go about developing a trade strategy? Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one? My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol
3. What should I¬†use¬†to trade futures? I have heard that Ninjatrader is good.

And the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped, mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in.

People have told me VOO > SPY, but then some others said $FXAIX > $VOO. Which, if any, is true? Should I invest in all 3? Also, is $200 a month enough? Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually? Does it really matter?

I realize this post is all over the place and I apologize, but it's all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward.

1diefni,NVDA after stock split won‚Äôt be like TSLA,"
Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let‚Äôs look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well.",2024-06-18 01:13:47,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1diefni/nvda_after_stock_split_wont_be_like_tsla/

1dbiohg,Why is there such risk aversion?  98% VOO +2% high-risk outperforms with minimal risk or volatility?  (Genuine question!),"I don't know if it's the bubbles I'm in or what social media feeds me, but it seems like everyone is either a high-stakes crypto/AI gambler, or someone who only advocates dumping everything into a basic market index and leaving it forever.

I haven't used the particular tracker before, but I picked the default date ranges and just picked a couple of high-risk plays for a two percent allocation (Bitcoin and Tesla).  I think there's no denying these were highly volatile and highly-valued.  But even if they went to zero it would have a minimal impact on the portfolio.

But the returns were several percent better than VOO/SPDR.  And a 98% VOO +2% high-risk also outperforms BrkB, while being significantly more diversified.

I think anyone who's trying to ""play it safe"" would be ecstatic to beat the market by 3% by only risking 2% of their allocation.

(I haven't tried it but suspect you could have a portfolio of 70% bonds 30% high-risk and do well with a capped drawdown).

I watched a video made by this Tesla bull investanswers and his stock price prediction for Tesla is 8k per share. He was modelling all the future business that Tesla will get into. For example, Energy storage, humanoid robots, FSD, robotaxis, etc. 

I only ask this question over here in this sub because I wanna hear the community's thoughts. 

As it stands, Tesla has a total shares outstanding of 3.189 Billion. Something along those lines. 

And if the stock price were to hit 8k per share, the market cap would be around 25 trillion.

1d758m7,2 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"For context, I planned on holding the original stocks for a few years, but ended up parlaying into AI when I developed strong conviction.

In previous posts, I shared more about the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind the investment decisions and reallocation. The previous 1 year update is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) Interestingly, the stock I lamented missing the run up on (Nvidia) is now by biggest holding and one of my best performers.

# Rate of return

The total rate of return since inception (June 2022 to May 2024) is¬†**77.90%**.¬†

# 3 ways my investing evolved

I‚Äôm still well within the ‚Äòmaybe I‚Äôm just lucky‚Äô phase since it‚Äôs only been a couple years, but I‚Äôve noticed I invest differently now than I have in the past:¬†

1. Insight¬†
2. Conviction¬†
3. Patience

**Insight**

I‚Äôve learned to largely ignore headlines and talking heads, which seem more reactionary than insightful and optimizing for entertainment (clicks/views).¬†

Ben Graham‚Äôs quote rings true:¬†

>‚ÄúIn the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.‚Äù

Perhaps counterintuitively, I‚Äôve found it more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts who focus on strategy and how that interacts with macro trends (along with financials) than solely financial analysts and stock pickers.¬†

Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but are backward-looking. However, valuation is forward-looking, thus driven by strategy x trends x structural advantages, so we must consider both.¬†

# Math

In 2023 I also started¬†practicing math daily¬†(243 days straight¬†as of this morning) in order to better understand the mathematics behind AI. As part of that, I had to take remedial coursework to build my foundations since it had been so long since I‚Äôd done any meaningful math.¬†

I‚Äôm not sure how much, but it¬†*feels*¬†like it helped with the reallocation decisions I made in late 2023 and early 2024. I felt more confident and deliberate in making trades. The math journey has been quite challenging, but personally rewarding, whether it has helped or not.¬†

**Conviction**

A big part of this is just a better understanding of myself and what kind of investor I am. I invest in what I believe in long-term.¬†

However, someone trading on volatility with a much shorter timeline may not care about conviction. You must understand what investment philosophy aligns with your psychology and your strengths.¬†

Conviction investing works for me because, even when building products (my day job), I‚Äôve always been strong with product vision/strategy and always building for the future, so it makes sense that I invest the same way. I‚Äôm not sure why it took me so long to connect those dots, but I‚Äôm happy I did.¬†

A big part of this is also timing. AI seems to be a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Whereas 5 years ago I might have tried to force myself to believe crypto was the next big thing in the absence of anything substantial.¬†

This is another reminder that success (in investing or otherwise) is all about timing and opportunity. When opportunities arise,¬†you must seize them.

**Patience**

As a result of my convictions, I‚Äôm much more patient in my investing these days and don‚Äôt react to the day-to-day.¬†

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I don‚Äôt make another trade for the rest of 2024.

A commenter asked about benchmarks, which I failed to include since I don't pay attention to them, so I had to look it up:

1jps2rr,Rivian posts sharp fall in quarterly deliveries as soft demand weighs,"(Reuters) - Rivian reported a 36% decline in first-quarter deliveries on Wednesday, as the electric-vehicle maker grapples with weak demand, sending its shares down nearly 6%.

EV makers have been battling tough demand as consumers opt for cheaper hybrid and gas-powered vehicles in an uncertain economic and political environment.

""I would say the sector at the moment is out of favor. Over the medium to long term, EVs are still inevitable, and so it's just going to take some time for these companies to continue to ramp up,"" said Andres Sheppard, senior equity analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.

Rivian Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough had said in February vehicle deliveries would be lower this year due to soft demand, partially because of the impact of fires in Los Angeles.

Demand could be further pressured as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies are expected to accelerate inflation and increase prices of automobiles, making consumers wary of committing to big purchases.

Sheppard said Rivian's margins would be affected by tariffs, and it could face a larger hit from the duties as opposed to bigger players such as Tesla.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe had said earlier this year the company expects higher costs from tariffs on Mexico and Canada as it has a supply chain footprint in these countries.

The company delivered 8,640 vehicles in the quarter ended March 31, down from 13,588 a year earlier. But the deliveries exceeded analysts' estimate of 8,200, according to Visible Alpha.

Tesla reported a 13% slump in quarterly sales, its weakest performance in nearly three years, as backlash to CEO Elon Musk's embrace of far-right politics grows and consumers seek out newer models from rival EV makers.

Rivian produced 14,611 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 13,980 a year ago. It reaffirmed its annual deliveries forecast.",2025-04-02 15:55:43,wallstreetbets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-reports-fall-first-quarter-123133853.html

But let me tell you, high volatily means high contract price and this is exactly what you don't want, whats the point ? You want to be that guy and cash out a 2 baggers out of a 30% intraday move on LUNR ? Non sense !

So i was digging up, looking for the next under the radar big movers and i think I've got something.

VITESSE ENERGY, a non-operating gas and oil company. 

let me explain, recently they posted earning wich missed big time due to their recent acquisition of Lucero energy. At the same they issued their quartermy dividend and the whole market was panik red.

You get the point, they were ""unrightfully"" oversold.

So my theory is that it can, in a matters of month rebound to a price around 26-27 due to these :

1- oversold yet fundamentals are good

2- in case of uncertain and bearish market investor tend to like energy stock and you can see a rise in volume

3- they focus on domestic production wich can be boosted by the tax war, focus on april 2

4- 90% of reddit talk about Raw material or some goofy biotech with the 35th potential cure for cancer or whatever

5- insiders are stock pilling like crazy

Position : 400 april-17 25c  snatched at 0.13ct not selling until 10 baggers, might revise depending on momentum and market.

1jiqjas,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE),¬†[VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

1jhai40,Can a Tesla advocate please explain how to justify the current P/E?,"I know this sub is all about *""line goes up who cares""*


But even after the recent drop, the P/E ratio is still around 110-120.

Doesn't that mean it would take 110 years of profit to buy the entire company at the current stock price?


What technology or product is going to come online that will make Tesla's profit increase ten fold?


For fuck sake, it is a car company ... And they have never sold that many cars when you compare to other car companies.


Someone that truly believes in the stock, explain to me like I am 5 why it will be more valuable in the future.

No political bullshit please, focus on business fundamentals.

1jfwuvf,It‚Äôs time to call bullshit,"I‚Äôll share a screenshot of my positions in a thread below, so if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre here for go ahead and look.

My fellow regards, I believe it‚Äôs time to call bullshit on this market. Please understand, I don‚Äôt care who you voted for‚Ä¶ I guarantee I like you a hell of a lot more than I like the banks, and that is exactly who the winner is going to be unless people wake up to the reality of our situation quickly. 

Before touching any kind of political news, let‚Äôs start with market indicators. 

BofA‚Äôs recent mm survey showed that most MM‚Äôs are reducing their share of US equities (source 1 below), there are other signs the banks are getting out as well (check my second to last post), BlackRock is struggling to find buyers. 

At the same time, a record number of American households now own stock in US equities (source 2 below). Now, from what I know about American households (I live in one), most of us live paycheck to paycheck‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really have money to put into stocks willy-nilly.


So what does all of this mean? 

Well, my thesis is that the average American has their rent/mortgage in US equities tied up in stocks like Tesla right now as an act of patriotism‚Ä¶ what saddens me most is that I appreciate this general sentiment (not for Tesla necessarily, but I do actually love my country despite what the news may tell you), but the banks are taking advantage of it. So what happens when all the sudden everyone has to pay their bills? 

That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ another mass sell off. 

Please believe me when I say that I hope I‚Äôm wrong, this is not going to be good for average, working people with, at the very least, good-hearted intentions‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt see any signs to indicate that I am.

Now we‚Äôll touch a bit on economic outlook and history:

We are currently still in a battle with inflation, JPow said it yesterday, even before tariffs we were looking at 2 more years before we return to normal and the outlook with tariffs puts it all on pause. He hedged to say ‚Äòthey aren‚Äôt sure how tariffs will affect inflation‚Äô, let me fill in the gap there: either tariffs will affect inflation (because the costs are passed on to consumers) or they will affect earnings (because companies absorb them)‚Ä¶ the money has to come from somewhere. If it affects inflation, the fed will be forced to raise interest rates or at the very least pause on cuts indefinitely. If it doesn‚Äôt affect inflation, it will affect earnings/growth‚Ä¶ if this sounds familiar, then you may have heard of stagflation. And if you study the history of the federal reserve, you may know what the solution to that problem is‚Ä¶ Volcker‚Äôs hammer. You can look it up yourself but the gist is that in the late 70‚Äôs we had been battling inflation and stagnant growth for years, until Paul Volcker was appointed to head the federal reserve and raised interest rates to 20%‚Ä¶ it absolutely crushed the economy, sent us to the stone ages‚Ä¶ but it did reset our inflation and led us into a very booming 80‚Äôs. 

I want to reiterate‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like either side politically, they‚Äôre all in bed with the banks. The only reason I‚Äôm posting this is because I‚Äôm angry at the thought of them getting super leveraged on overpriced stocks and then dumping it on average people. This has so many shades of 2008 it‚Äôs not funny. Feel free to argue, bet against me, whatever‚Ä¶ I genuinely don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôve been a value investor since I was 14 and I‚Äôm currently 28. I held through 2020 and 2022, this time feels much much different. 

Whatever you decide to do with this information, be safe out there.

1jfwcij,Lyft to Offer Driverless Ride-Hails ‚Äòas Soon as This Summer‚Äô,"(Bloomberg) -- Lyft Inc. said it plans to offer driverless vehicles on its platform ‚Äúas soon as this summer,‚Äù and that it sees human drivers transitioning to other work such as fleet management as autonomous rides become more ubiquitous.

The company has been spending more time pitching its vision for the future of its gig-economy business model as it plays catch-up in offering autonomous rides. Driverless ride-hailing has become more commonplace in some key US markets through competing platforms. Like rival Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft envisions a hybrid future where human drivers will complement autonomous vehicle fleets, especially during periods of peak demand.

The autonomous-vehicle economy will create new jobs such as remote vehicle support, fleet management, and map data labeling and validation, said Jeremy Bird, Lyft‚Äôs executive vice president in charge of driver experience, said Thursday in a blog post. He also confirmed the driverless service could begin as early as this summer. The company had previously committed to a launch sometime in 2025.

Bird also said the idea of drivers eventually owning autonomous vehicles is core to the company‚Äôs strategy, and this will become more feasible as the cost falls for those cars. That would enable drivers to operate small fleets, not unlike how some Airbnb Inc. hosts have made a business out of renting out multiple properties. Elon Musk has a similar vision in which Tesla owners would monetize their vehicles when they aren‚Äôt personally using them.

‚ÄúEven when technology encroaches on human jobs, it doesn‚Äôt eliminate the need for humans altogether ‚Äî especially when workers can provide value that the machines cannot,‚Äù Bird wrote. ‚ÄúHumans are features, not bugs, and we‚Äôll continue to find a way to reward those that provide great service as part of a thriving hybrid network.‚Äù

Lyft and Uber currently rely on millions of drivers to quickly match with riders. But Lyft, which only operates in the US and Canada, is more exposed to increasing competition from domestic autonomous ride providers such as Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Waymo.

Waymo began offering driverless service more broadly in major markets like San Francisco and Los Angeles last year, and has partnered exclusively with Uber to offer those rides in Austin starting this month. The two companies have a similar agreement to launch driverless trips in Atlanta this summer.

When Lyft launches its first driverless trips, it will be through existing partnerships, including with Toyota Motor Corp.-backed startup May Mobility in Atlanta.

Lyft shares have declined 9% since the start of the year, while Uber‚Äôs have gained 23% so far.

Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has gone so far as to predict that human drivers will eventually be displaced as autonomous software develops superior driving skills over the next 15 to 20 years. The company has made some early efforts to help create new earnings opportunities for its network of gig workers, including piloting a Taskrabbit-like service where customers can hire people to complete various household tasks. It‚Äôs also recruiting coders and language experts to fuel its new AI data labeling business.

In his blog post, Lyft‚Äôs Bird stopped short of predicting when drivers might be displaced, instead saying that driverless cars will create new opportunities for drivers. That includes manual work required to service, maintain and charge the vehicles. These are ‚Äújobs for which drivers are well suited,‚Äù Bird added.

The industry will also need customer service workers to respond to unusual events during driverless rides. In Lyft‚Äôs case, 30% of the staff working in its fleet management unit Flexdrive are former or current Lyft drivers, Bird wrote.

The company has also proposed ways for drivers to find jobs in other industries, offering free training to enter the tech industry. CEO David Risher also recently announced a new feature that uses AI to generate a recommendation letter, which active drivers in good standing can share with potential employers.",2025-03-20 18:50:24,wallstreetbets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyft-offer-driverless-ride-hails-175137007.html

1jf9qq8,What's TSLA worth in a fire sale?,"Occasionally, I see people suggest TSLA could go to $0. Obviously, any company can go to $0 if it's mismanaged for long enough, so sure, TSLA could go to $0. But some people have explicitly claimed that TSLA is basically a dead man walking, and could go to $0 any day now. This seems wrong, and it's kind of become a pet peeve for me.  
  
But what's the right answer? What's TSLA worth if tomorrow Elon Musk has a psychotic break tomorrow and is filmed running naked through the National Mall, a la the Kony 2012 guy?

Tesla's [most recent annual financial statement](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings) lists a ""stockholder's equity"" also known as book value, of $72.913 billion. Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)

That $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in ""current assets"", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):

>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.

If you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like ""cash"" and ""short-term investments"". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is ""inventory"", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.

Now, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but ""deferred tax assets"" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?

So maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.

I'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.

Even though, yeah, fuck Elon.

Anyway, here's my position, which I'm holding today's movement be damned:

1j9cirg,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,"The S&P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I‚Äôm referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I‚Äôve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ON V0 is a game changer because the current model L60 and future models are priced for the mass market.¬† ¬†\*\*They even have access to NIO‚Äôs battery swapping stations!!!\*\*¬† This is huge because right now there is no brand that currently offers battery swapping.¬† ¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Battery Swapping technology is what differentiate NIO from their competitors because it takes 5 minutes to change a battery and you are on your way.¬† ¬†They just completed 1 million swaps during the two weeks from Chinese New Year.¬† The reason why Tesla abandoned the tech is because infrastructure isn‚Äôt there/too expensive, but I can tell you it works and it works flawlessly.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Owns/operate the most battery charging stations in China and along highways, the Shanghai charging/swapping operations are about to turn profitable.¬† ¬†Many EV companies use their charging stations as well.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Priced cheaply compared to all other EV Brands, yes because they are not selling as much but be greedy when others are fearful

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† US politics is a mess right now and in the near future, with DOGE and Trump creating a lot of uncertainties, I believe funds will move back to China as China is very proactive in getting investments back and is actually publicly protecting/enhancing their tech industry instead of beating them down like few yrs ago(check out Chinese equities)

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Their CEO mentioned that NIO is seeking to achieve profitability in the last quarter of 2025!!

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They will never go bankrupt as it is backed by the government, Tencent, Abu-Dhabi‚Äôs CYVN Holdings , so there is essentially zero risk of bankruptcy

**Cons:**

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Low sales numbers relative to all other brands but I firmly believe this will change as more people recognize the utility of battery swaps

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lots of competition in Chinese EV market, but if they break through the mass market, there will be a huge upside

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They still have very low sales outside China, so it is less vulnerable to tariff compared to other manufacturers, although they are expanding in Europe and have plans for Middle East.

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hemorrhaging cash but they aim to be profitable year end

¬†

Everything is coming together for this company.¬†¬† While other Chinese EV stocks went up a lot already like Xpeng and LI.¬† ¬†They are just amazing cars, period. ¬†Don‚Äôt look at outdated review from youtube comparing apples to oranges.¬† They are great cars.¬† I firmly because the risk/reward for this is amazing.¬† ¬†Losing 30% of your investment for have a potential for few baggers sounds absolutely amazing to me.¬† ¬†It is absolutely no brainer, just look at my last DD for Palantir, I am still holding it and at a 8 bagger as of today. ¬†¬†I put my money where my mouth is.¬† No options for me because of the high volatility right now.   

Position is 260,000 shares @ 4.63

Sorry for the long post. Good luck everyone!!

1iuykwm,"the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)","A few days ago, I saw the[ \[DD\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.

Today I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.

**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**

Why does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?

The answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.

[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.

Don‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.

Let me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.

**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**

Alright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.

First, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.

You see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.

If there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.

As if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†

If you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†

What does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù

I recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù

By way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.

Here is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:

>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

Trump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.

Furthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\*\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\*\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.

**Part III: Positions**

Where to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.

https://preview.redd.it/gtl426m18rke1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46ae72c3552c0d547b0e3c58f81aa77087fdc82

Why did I pick these? (don't mind Humana, Uber, VST)

>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.

>**LYS** is AU but part of ""The Quad"" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes ""(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.""

>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration

>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).

>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)

>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: ""(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.""

>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.

>**TLOFF** is nickel, partnered with TSLA

>**ABAT** is US lithium batteries supply/recycling

>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.

I'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:

>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so""

1iuxffd,Rivian (RIVN) Earnings Review - Bullish,"TLDR: Rivian is a BUY, because it‚Äôs cheap  

Post earnings call, Rivian has found gross profit, reducing vehicle production costs by $30k.  

Eyeing the R2 release in a year, they‚Äôve sourced 95% of materials for it at half the cost of R1, seeing growing bargaining power in negotiations while realizing opportunities for production efficiencies.

People are pumped about the R2 release.  

With $7B of cash they are guiding towards a <($2B) loss for 2025 -  

leaving $5B of cash + $3.4B more from VW deal, putting them at a future $8.4B in cash alone for capex and expansion.  

While the DOE loan might see pressure, they will also create **7500 US MANUFACTURING JOBS in Georgia**.  

Killing manufacturing jobs isn‚Äôt really aligned with the current admin goals, even as they talk about ICE vehicles and the need to drill more.  

Guidance for ‚Äò25 was conservatively flat given the environment, however -  

With Tesla protests happening and a deep fleet of existing owners, the Tesla to Rivian trade-up is happening in force, which will especially add to R2 demand and existing R1 demand.  

Between R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‚Äò26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  

All of which doesn‚Äôt include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.

Rivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.  

Rivian is well capitalized, backed by big players who believe in their position, and most importantly -  

PEOPLE LOVE THEIR PRODUCT.  

In the last year, Rivian is down 15%, while the company position and story becomes better and better.  

Love the trade and upside here!

https://www.energy.gov/lpo/project-horizon

That loan is much needed by RIVN. 

They lose roughly $39,000 per vehicle sold currently, have $5.74B in debt and $7.70B in cash. TTM net income is -$4.75B. 

Once Trump took office, he vowed to ‚Äúlook into‚Äù the Rivian loan. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fate-rivian-6-6-billion-174558360.html?guccounter=1

Since Elon Musk is making most of these decisions, and he has shown to clearly bias his own businesses thus far with Tesla and SpaceX, it‚Äôs likely that they find a way to cancel this loan. 

If the loan gets cancelled, RIVN will sell off.

1irml3j,BlackBerry: A Legacy Stock That‚Äôs Going To Get Re-Rated And Run,"BlackBerry is not a dead brand. It‚Äôs not a failed smartphone company. It‚Äôs not just another stock that spikes when retail traders pile in and then disappears.

It is a deeply entrenched, high-margin infrastructure software business that has gone completely unnoticed in the AI-driven rally. While every software stock remotely connected to AI, IoT, or automation trades at sky-high valuations, BlackBerry‚Äîwhich powers 255M+ vehicles and counting‚Äîstill trades like a company with no future.

The reality is different. BlackBerry dominates real-time, safety-critical automotive systems with its QNX operating system, and it‚Äôs now layering on a SaaS-like business with IVY, a cloud-based vehicle data platform co-developed with AWS.

IVY allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize vehicle sensor data in real time. This is exactly the kind of AI-adjacent, cloud-powered software business that should be trading at 10x revenue, yet the market assigns it zero value.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX is embedded in 255M+ vehicles and continues to expand at 20M+ per year.
* IVY has secured early adopters, including Foxconn‚Äôs MIH EV platform, Dongfeng, and Mitsubishi Electric.
* The cybersecurity division, generating $350M‚Äì$365M annually, is now stabilized and profitable.

Every other infrastructure software business with this kind of positioning has already been re-rated higher‚Äîthis one just hasn‚Äôt caught up yet.

# The Trade: BlackBerry Gets Re-Rated in the Next 2‚Äì3 Quarters‚ÄîPossibly as Soon as Earnings April 2nd

QNX is growing, IVY is ramping up, and cybersecurity has stabilized, yet the stock price still reflects none of this.

* If BlackBerry provides strong IVY guidance next earnings, the re-rating could start immediately.
* Even without IVY, QNX‚Äôs backlog alone justifies a higher multiple.
* Cybersecurity, previously a drag on performance, is now quietly generating cash.

This setup provides a margin of safety with significant upside.

Even if IVY takes time to scale, QNX alone is worth more than what the market is assigning to BlackBerry today.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as an infrastructure software business, it trades at $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters. That does not include IVY guidance or it's potential impact on price, which could drive the stock much higher.

# QNX: The Operating System Running Inside 255M+ Vehicles

QNX is not an infotainment OS‚Äîit‚Äôs the real-time, safety-critical software running inside automotive systems.

* Installed in 255M+ vehicles, growing by 20M+ per year
* $815M backlog (+27% YoY) ensures forward revenue visibility
* Trusted by nearly every major automaker, including BMW, Toyota, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Honda, Stellantis, Bosch, Continental, Magna, and Denso

QNX is embedded in ADAS, digital instrument clusters, telematics, and secure gateways‚Äîsystems where failure is not an option. Automakers don‚Äôt replace this kind of software lightly, which is why QNX enjoys high retention and a long revenue tail.

As vehicles become more software-driven, QNX‚Äôs role is only growing.

* Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) require real-time OS solutions that QNX already dominates
* QNX Hypervisor enables multiple systems to run securely on a single chip, increasing its value per vehicle
* EVs and autonomous systems require low-latency, high-reliability computing‚Äîexactly what QNX provides

If QNX were valued like a strategic AI-driven infrastructure software provider, it would not be trading at 5x revenue.

A more appropriate 8‚Äì10x multiple puts QNX‚Äôs valuation at $2.5B‚Äì$3.5B alone.

Right now, the market is treating QNX like a legacy asset when it‚Äôs actually growing and gaining importance.

# IVY: The Unpriced SaaS Upside That Could Change the Entire Valuation

BlackBerry IVY is a co-developed vehicle data platform with AWS that allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize in-car data.

* Foxconn‚Äôs MIH EV platform, Dongfeng Motors, and Mitsubishi Electric have already signed on
* IVY enables software-driven revenue streams for automakers (subscriptions, upgrades, real-time analytics)
* BlackBerry captures recurring revenue from these services

Right now, the market assigns IVY zero value because revenue has not yet scaled.

But automakers are moving toward Tesla-style in-car software features, usage-based pricing, and over-the-air upgrades.

If IVY becomes the data layer that enables this shift, BlackBerry‚Äôs valuation moves toward SaaS multiples instead of just embedded software.

And we will know a lot more by next earnings.

# Cybersecurity: No Longer a Drag, Now a Cash Generator

For years, BlackBerry‚Äôs cybersecurity business was bloated and uncompetitive.

* Then management sold off Cylance, cut unnecessary costs, and focused on high-trust, high-retention government and enterprise contracts.
* Cybersecurity now generates $350M‚Äì$365M annually with a $280M ARR & Margins have improved to 65%
* Trusted by NATO, Fortune 500s, and government agencies

This is not a high-growth business, but it is a stable, profitable enterprise software business that the market is ignoring.

Even at a conservative 2‚Äì4x revenue multiple, cybersecurity alone could be worth $700M‚Äì$1.2B.

Right now, the market is treating this business as worthless, which makes no sense.

# Market Mispricing: How Big Is the Upside?

BlackBerry is currently trading at \~5x sales, significantly below comparable infrastructure software businesses.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as a legitimate infrastructure software provider, the stock is an easy double from here.

A reasonable valuation based on its components:

* QNX at 8‚Äì10x revenue ‚Üí $2.5B‚Äì$3.5B
* Cybersecurity at 2‚Äì4x revenue ‚Üí $700M‚Äì$1.2B
* IVY is completely unpriced‚Äîif it scales, it could be worth billions

**This pushes BlackBerry‚Äôs fair value toward $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters on the low end, $20+ on the high end if IVY scales.**

If IVY guidance is strong next earnings, that re-rating could start immediately.

# Final Thought: The Market Is About to Wake Up

This is not a meme stock revival.

It is an AI-adjacent, embedded infrastructure software business that has somehow escaped the AI stock rally.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX should not be trading like a no-growth legacy product
* IVY is being assigned zero value, despite real partnerships and revenue potential
* Cybersecurity is now a stable asset, not a liability

This stock is one strong IVY earnings guide away from a re-rating to juicy SAAS multiples. BlackBerry is almost certainly about to be priced like a great software company instead of a clown show. When that happens, it‚Äôs not trading anywhere near $5.69 anymore.

I‚Äôve put together the above analysis of BlackBerry. I work on these memos for my own personal investments and want to start sharing them. Thought you degens might like them.

I'm going to be posting diligence on reddit regularly, but only on r/wallstreetbets for positions in my personal book. Follow me on directly if you want to read more.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates BlackBerry is a high-margin software business that the market doesn't believe could operate a coffee cart at an airport. Their IOT businesses includes the dominant OS for automotive software and an emerging SaaS platform co-developed with AWS both of which should command high multiples. The stock trades at a massive discount to comparable AI-adjacent infrastructure software businesses. In a base case, the stock should trade at $12‚Äì$18 in the next 2‚Äì3 quarters and if IOT guidance is strong next earnings it can pop to 20+.",2025-02-17 15:36:20,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1irml3j/blackberry_a_legacy_stock_thats_going_to_get/
1ipmhfx,"Bridgewater is Betting on TSLA, Dumps GS and Buys More MRNA","Bridgewater Associates, the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, made a notable shift in its investment strategy late last year, increasing its stake in electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla while exiting positions in major companies like Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology.

According to Bridgewater‚Äôs latest 13-F filing, the firm purchased $62 million worth of Tesla shares, representing a 0.28% stake in the company during the fourth quarter of 2024. Tesla stock experienced a post-election rally following the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, largely due to CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs close relationship with the new administration. By the end of 2024, Tesla‚Äôs stock had surged 62%, but 2025 has proven more challenging, with shares already down 12%, amid concerns over slowing sales and Musk‚Äôs increasing involvement in other ventures.

Meanwhile, Bridgewater also expanded its position in Moderna, the vaccine manufacturer, acquiring 605,782 shares for a 0.12% stake. At the same time, it completely exited investments in Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology while drastically reducing its holdings in Applied Materials, a semiconductor company. The hedge fund further trimmed its exposure to consumer staples, cutting stakes in CVS Health and Tyson Foods, signaling a strategic shift in its portfolio.

1io2cwt,$INTC The most hated 10 bagger that will make grandma proud,"TLDR; only truly American fab. With AI race at full speed, semiconductor hardware (NOT SOFTWARE) will become the defining strategic resource of the superpowers. 


People will say oh but TSMC is better at production, but NVDA designs better chips, but AMD. We have to take a trip through the history of TSMC and its founder Morris Chang as well as the cold war. 

Let's look at Morris. He went to Harvard and MIT and then stayed in the US to work for Texas Instruments for 30 years, obtaining his American citizenship in the process. 30 years is more time than many in this app have lived thus far. I'd say he's an American through and through. He was next in line for the position of CEO at TI, but ultimately because he was of Chinese descent he was turned down for the role. Now, at the age of 55, the Taiwanese government reached out to him to fund a fab company; TSMC is born. 

AI will be more important than the space race and the nuclear arms race. The implications are so profound that nations are no longer cooperating to build it together and are strategically trying to limit the advancement of their enemies; e.g. blocking Nividia chip sales to China. The most effective embargo is a hardware embargo. 

With national security at stake, if they didn't trust Morris to run TI, what would make them trust TSMC to be the sole provider of chips to America? And on a side note, with TSMC in Taiwan and the vast majority of chips being produced in a country neighboring China, that risk level is over 9000. China is already designing and producing their own  chips with varying degrees of success. You guys can fill in the blank of what the US government fears the most. It is absolutely crucial to have production back in the US. 

That leaves us with the only option, Intel. It is the only company that has a full white lineage of leadership. Real American Company as some would say.

1ik29w3,Tesla and the mark to market cliff,"Long time lurker, I just wanted to share an idea that is my head since this morning. Sorry in advance for my English, besides being novice in trading, I am not a native English speaker. 

It looks like it is going to be a rough quarter for Tesla and it is quite obvious that the P/E ratio is quite crazy. But, let's be honest, value investing is long outdated, so trying to be bearish at this point with these meme stocks is absurd.

And still I ask myself if it is possible to make money of this situation... And I was thinking. These fuckers are holding a big amount of ""alternative"" cash in their balance sheet, which does not looks like to be a healthy strategy for a serious company, is not possible to take advantage of it?

I mean, I don't know exactly which ""alternative"" cash ;) are they holding and I am too lazy to do the research, but many of these are quite iliquid and, consequently, quite easy to manipulate.

What impedes somebody with enough financial muscle of making a few big transactions at the end of March, so the Mark to market of these show a big loss when revaluated? Wouldn't be enough to, combined with the lower revenue and the huge overvalued share price, tu push the stock over the cliff?

Indees, cannot a few people coordinate this and take a few puts on the share? Indeed, Tesla cannot sell the ""alternative"" currency without realizing a big loss due to the illiquidity of it and the panic effect could imply. Unless they are holding everything in the most well known ""alternative currency"", and even this one can be manipulated, they would push too much the price down.

Just wondering, probably I am missing millions of reasons why this will not work (mostly that the market is even more crazy than us and will hold on the stock or even buy even more), but I would like to hear them!",2025-02-07 18:41:42,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ik29w3/tesla_and_the_mark_to_market_cliff/

1iizdo7,DD: Big Bear AI ($BBAI) - palantir 2.0,"I‚Äôm looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when ""[geneman7](https://www.reddit.com/user/geneman7/)"" said PLTR bumpy revenues weren‚Äôt a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when ""[geneman7](https://www.reddit.com/user/geneman7/)"" said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when ""[geneman7](https://www.reddit.com/user/geneman7/)"" said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It‚Äôs true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money. Ironically in Big Bear AI the bears will eventually become bulls.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner and PLTR 2.0. Time to get hyped.

Big Bear AI ($BBAI): 1.8b market cap - Float 173M Short 37.4M = 21.6% SI

BBAI started as a SPAC in 2021 and besides a few spikes it was only downward trajectory. Until now, a huge spike in stock price and currently holds above the 52wk high.

Strengths:

* Innovative Technology: BBAI leverages advanced AI and machine learning capabilities to transform complex data into actionable insights, enhancing decision-making processes across various industries.
* Diverse Client Base: The company serves multiple sectors, including defense, healthcare, and finance, diversifying its revenue streams and reducing dependence on any single market.
* Established Government Contracts:¬†[BigBear.ai](http://bigbear.ai/)¬†has secured significant contracts with federal government agencies, providing a stable revenue stream and long-term growth potential.
* Strategic Acquisitions: The acquisition of Pangiam in February 2024 expanded BigBear.ai's capabilities and market presence, particularly in security and intelligence solutions.

Weaknesses:

* Financial Challenges: As of the third quarter of 2024,¬†[BigBear.ai](http://bigbear.ai/)¬†reported an accumulated deficit of $462 million, with operating cash flow remaining negative over recent years.

Now the spicy stuff:

**- Ties to Trump administration**

New CEO Kevin McAleenan is best known for his role as the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). McAleenan also was the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Words of Trump himself:¬†*‚ÄúI will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places in which they came,‚Äù*¬†Guess which company will benefit of this.

**- Pangiam acquisition = Vision AI - CHECK THEIR WEBSITE and what they are doing**

Vision AI is increasingly being used in border control

\-¬†**Jim Cramer said no**

TLDR:

My bet is BBAI has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration. Government contracts will start flowing in and airports will adopt BBAI's AI software completely.

Seeing Palantir at a 230b valuation makes me think BBAI is just getting started

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I‚Äôm doing.

1ih6aa7,I hold both $PLTR Palantir and $BB Blackberry. Why I'm confident Blackberry will be the next Palantir,"Ah yes, I'll say it first, ""oh look, another BlackBerry thread, these always come up once every year and nothing ever happens"" or ""been holding BBags since $15"". Well, I've been holding onto my BBags for 4 years (just as I have with Palantir) - you can check my posting history for receipts - and I'm holding for glory.

Back to the comparison. Once upon a time, Palantir was building an operating system called Foundry that Wallstreet and paperhands collectively decided could be a worthless pipedream and dropped it back to and below it's original DPO price to $6 and change.

Fast forward to today and the stock is $100 and you have Dr. Alex Karp saying this:

***‚ÄúFor the first time people want to partner with us, it used to be partnership meetings where it was a complete waste of time and BS just so they can say they met with us like high school dating for nerds‚Ä¶now, I have real partnership discussions because a lot of these people in verticals have to deliver and are under a lot of pressure and know how good our products are‚Äù. - Alex Karp***

\----------------

Now lets compare this to BlackBerry with a short little history lesson. Okay, a super short  history lesson. Forget their phones ever existed - they acquired a company called QNX in 2010 and have since been the de facto **OPERATING SYSTEM** for most cars not named Tesla and are in 24/25 EV's that are becoming increasingly complex and data driven (they also have a significant presence in the growing medical devices field and soon to be robotics field as well, which are gravy on top of the cherry).

Palantir was head banging away 20+ years to get their operating system to be future proof (okay, admittedly I don't know if it actually took them 20 years to develop Foundry, but lets go with that) and similarly, BlackBerry has been doing the same with QNX.

Now lets read a couple quotes from the BlackBerry team about QNX.

Quote #1:  
***The moat -- the competitive moat around this QNX business continues to remain very deep.***

***And to John's point, if anything, we're in a fairly strong position here that OEMs are coming to us and asking us to do more. - Tim Foote, Chief Financial Officer***

Quote #2:  
***Customers are now coming to QNX for its proven safety and security credentials, which are essential in today's market. - John Chen, Former CEO***

\-----------------

Okay, now it's time for you to do some brain work and think this thought through carefully. Do you think an operating system that makes your car and whatever future car(s) you're going to buy (unless you buy a Tesla) functional and is critical for safety, is worth only 3.71 billion dollars?

What if I told you that this operating system could also be the foundation for medical devices that'll keep you alive after your 10th trip to Vegas or Thailand? Or what if I told you that it could be integral to making sure that your robot housemaid isn't stealing your girlfriend/wife/boyfriend?

The TLDR of all of this is:

Would you rather buy a McD's burger for $4 or a single share of an operating system that hasn't yet been discovered as the most secure operating system for cars and in the future, robotics and medical devices?

\------------------

My total dollar amounts invested (attached a screenshot for proof):

$BB:  
Account #1 - $173,644.56 CAD (currently worth $114,615.60 CAD)  
Account #2 - $128,885.98 CAD (currently worth $53,922 CAD)

I just had my fattest month in the market‚Äî$62K in gains‚Äîand I‚Äôm here to gloat like a Redditor who just discovered options trading.

HIMS: Started with 1,000 shares at $16, rode that chunky telehealth piggy up to $33, took profits, then reloaded with 2,000 shares at $24. Within weeks, turned $48K into $78K. Sold half, still holding 1,000 shares through earnings, because I expect this thing to go so parabolic it‚Äôll need a prescription for high blood pressure.

Netflix? While you nerds were binge-watching Squid Game again, I was making money. Dropped $9K into calls, flipped them for a $19K gain, and trimmed 20 shares out of my 100 to lock in some more profits. All this inside my Roth, except for 700 shares of HIMS and the Netflix calls, because I like to keep some risk where Uncle Sam can‚Äôt touch it.

Best play of the year? RIVIAN. Scooped 2,000 shares around $12, and this thing is gearing up like a Tesla owner explaining why gas is a scam.

Total haul? $62K in gains. And with all these HIMS profits, I have so much Viagra I could go round-for-round in a gay bear orgy and still have enough left to keep the entire subreddit‚Äôs dads awake at night.

1iga6kw,You all are overlooking a giant opportunity‚ÄîGoogle!,"In the fiscal year 2024 Google‚Äôs net profit was more than Apple. Google‚Äòs revenue grew double digit while Apple was below 5%. It is the only AI company that is vertically integrated - from chips to compute to distribution. If TikTok didn‚Äôt get banned, there is no chance in hell that US is breaking Google‚Äôs Monopoly. 

It behaves like a mature company. The stock isn‚Äôt as volatile as Meta. The CEO doesn‚Äôt abruptly change plans and plunge billions of dollars into random personal projects.


It is the only company that has self driving cabs running for probably almost 2 years now in multiple cities without any major issue . And let me be clear there is no second option till date. Every other company is just training or experimenting. A big assumption is that Elmo will change regulation to benefit from it for their Robo taxi operation, but the regulation isn‚Äôt what is stopping Tesla from becoming a robot taxi company they haven‚Äôt proven their tech yet. 

Yes, AI might be something that could be disrupting or changing a lot of Google‚Äôs original business. But it‚Äôs not like their AI is completely shitty. It‚Äôs still amongst the top and they have an ecosystem which can easily leverage this. I suspect Apple losing out on the market because of Apple Intelligence being subpar. Google will end up creating a personal AI because of the amount of personal data it has from all of us. No other company can do that because they just don‚Äôt have access to all of this. 

Googles search business was still growing at 10% per year. Even if the number of searches go down because people start using AI, we haven‚Äôt seen any meaningful difference in Google usage so in the worst case, I would just assume that this business isn‚Äôt growing for my calculation. But its AI would still accelerate Google cloud and YouTube. And the advertisers are not really going to AI company because they haven‚Äôt figured out their business yet and for the time being it‚Äôs going to be like a subscription based business. 

Apple and Google are still going to benefit because of their ecosystem. It makes harder for anyone to leave them. This hasn‚Äôt historically existed in my opinion when we look at other companies like yahoo or IBM.

And the cherry on top is, it‚Äôs the most undervalued big tech right now. ",2025-02-02 22:53:22,wallstreetbets,https://i.redd.it/f9kzh2ai2tge1.jpeg

1idms3t,QQQ up with trash Q1 estimates - puts at open?,"Pulled out of the market yesterday. But a few interesting observations - everybody missed Q1 top line forecasts on growth.

Meta and Tesla crashed on earnings drop due to missing Q1 forecasts before recovering. Microsoft crashed after Q1 forecast released on earnings call.

Microsoft hinted ""data center computing"" execution driving capacity constraints through Q1, mirroring reports of Blackwell chips overheating earlier this year.

Not surprisingly, Deepseek inference cost reduction implications due to MOE approach yet to be factored in; capex estimates seem to be in line with end of year plans.

Apple on deck today. Profitability expected to be good due to efficiency in production, but Q1 forecasted top line also expected to be trash due to China and Apple intelligence failing.

Still a believer in big tech, but current multiples are historically high with interest rates still near historic highs in the near future which implies expectations of meteoric growth. There seems to be hell of a lot of risk in the market for big bets that won't play out for at least 6 months.

If this pump holds up: QQQ 2/14 520P

To be clear, not all bad news. Killer profitability from Meta, and Musk did a masterpiece on painting the future of FSD and Optimus sooner than we thought, but that's what Musk does.

1id1rk1,Considering TSLA Earnings today,"I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. I haven't really made a text post here before but I've seen the type of DD posted here and wanted to put in my own thoughts and get everyone's idea on Tesla's earnings today. I'm not here to suggest plays or talk about Elon's Tweets. Just the raw facts and what people think of the stock.

First off, Tesla is expected to report an adjusted profit of 77 cents per share, with sales at $27.2 billion. That's a step up from last year's 71 cents per share and $25.2 billion in sales. That's pretty good. In Q4 2024, Tesla cranked out approximately 459,000 vehicles and delivered over 495,000. While these are record numbers, they still fell short of the ambitious targets set by the Musk himself. That being said, these are all previous numbers and we need to try to predict today's numbers. With expectations so high, it might be difficult to beat earnings tonight.

We need to address the new administration obviously. They're going to be phasing out EV incentives so Tesla's projected sales might not be as high as we think. Elon has been touting a 20%-30% sales growth for 2025, but with reduced EV demand and competition from China... it might not be realistic.

Tesla might announce advancements in autonomous driving and upcoming product launches to keep the momentum going. A lower-priced EV, updated models, and the potential rollout of Full Self-Driving and robotaxi services are all in the pipeline. If Tesla can pull these off, it might just silence the haters and send the shorts running for cover. However, considering the last 10 years of ""improvements,"" it's highly unlikely.

Now consider what I've written above and the fact that the stock has dropped drastically 5 out of 7 previous earnings. What do you guys think?",2025-01-29 19:08:22,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1id1rk1/considering_tsla_earnings_today/
1id1pqu,Let's talk about META's earnings.,"Zuckerberg's earnings are today and I wanted to drop my 2 cents and see if anyone's up to discuss. I'm re-writing to better along with WSB's rules. I recently tried to make a post about Tesla but it was taken down too by an AI bot for being too political? This is my first discussion post so I'm really testing out the waters on this sub. 

Meta Platforms is set to announce its fourth-quarter results after the market closes and from what I've read analysts are predicting earnings of $6.76 per share, up from $5.33 a year ago. Revenue is expected to hit $47.04 billion, marking a 17% increase year-over-year. Right now it seems like people are particularly keen to see how Meta's hefty investments in artificial intelligence are paying off.

Unfortunately for Meta, DeepSeek has been making waves with its R1 model. It's a Chinese competitor that matches the capabilities of models from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Meta but was developed at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek's success has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, causing significant stock drops for companies like Nvidia. It's pretty common for China to steal proprietary tech and incorporate it into their own creations, but their AI is entirely open source, unlike OpenAI. This would allow American companies to, in turn, take their new research and work with it. For those who don't know, Meta themselves has an Open-Source Strategy. Their Cheif AI Scientist, Yann LeCun isn't sweating it, though. DeepSeek's R1 is open-source, just like Meta's own Llama model, which in turn validates Meta's open-source approach. Collaboration and transparency might be the goal in the AI race. However, people are wondering how such advancements could be made with such a low budget. This puts into question the amount of funding and money that's currently going into AI.

Despite the DeepSeek-induced drop, Meta's stock has shown resilience. Analysts at Citi argue that Meta could actually benefit from DeepSeek's innovations by incorporating them to enhance its own AI tools, potentially leading to more efficient operations and better returns on investment. As Meta prepares to unveil its earnings, everyone wants to see how the company plans to monetize its AI investments and respond to the rising competition from players like DeepSeek. The tech landscape is shifting, and Meta's next moves could set the tone for the industry's future.

But the earning call won't be entirely about AI. They obviously own Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Advertising remains the cornerstone of Meta's revenue, accounting for approximately 98% of its total income. I believe Meta's significant investments in artificial intelligence have enhanced its advertising capabilities. AI-powered tools like Advantage+ and generative AI enable advertisers to create highly targeted campaigns, leading to increased return on ad spend. The company reported a 7% year-over-year increase in ad impressions and an 11% rise in average ad prices. Over a million businesses utilized Meta's generative AI tools to produce 15 million ads in a single month, resulting in a 7% uplift in conversions.

Meta's platforms continue to see robust user engagement. The company boasts 3.29 billion daily active users, a 5% increase from the previous year. AI-enhanced content recommendations have driven higher engagement, particularly for video content, thereby boosting advertising opportunities. However, Despite these positive indicators, Meta faces several challenges. The company's Reality Labs division, focused on metaverse initiatives, is expected to report a $5 billion loss for Q4, continuing to weigh on overall profitability. Additionally, regulatory scrutiny, such as the European Union‚Äôs Digital Markets Act, poses risks to Meta's data-driven advertising model, potentially leading to increased compliance costs and fines. Competition from platforms like TikTok, Google, and Amazon remains intense, with TikTok's popularity among younger users particularly threatening Meta's growth in key demographics. Although Tiktok's impending ban might really help them monopolize the social media industry.

Everything is telling me that earnings will be bullish. Thoughts?",2025-01-29 19:06:21,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1id1pqu/lets_talk_about_metas_earnings/

1iatjmu,My loss of 2024,"The word of the day is greed. I started trading options this year (2024) and this is how it went. 
Messed around with some small cap calls lost 100% on some and made 300% on others. my eyes grew big I had no idea you could make 300% off a stock moving 5 or 10%. 
I went HEAVEY into Dd around June and would stay up all night sometimes just to loose the next day but I never gave up. One day around September when they did the rate cuts I heard the news bought in Nvidia and QQQ calls right before close. They both gapped up the next day. I traded on that market open ended up making quite a few trades turned $200 into 5000 in 24 hours.  
I go back to focusing on DD and find my next opportunity.  I remember trading other things making too many trades. Started drinking a lot wishing everyday could be like that day. My account goes down to 2,000. I put everything into Tesla calls right before earnings and my sober mind set up the play where I could buy 100 shares of Tesla at 230 for just 1800 dollars. How? Well Tesla was at 216 and had record sells so I bought a weekly 230 and 13 weekly 240s. I‚Äôll be damned if that plan didn‚Äôt work out. But my paper handing ass sold at market open and fucked it all up.  That‚Äôs where the downward spiral started. 

In the next trading week 

I went all in on qqq calls 1 dte and it tanked the next day. Anyways after that trade (late October) I went on a downward spiral and a pretty bad one. Almost lost everything. 
(Not just money but my family, house, business). 
I was drinking way to much to cope with the pain was my excuse. but on Christmas I put it down haven‚Äôt drank since. Everyday I do dd on company‚Äôs and watch the charts. plan my next move also started reading the intelligent investor that Warren buffet recommends. This year will be different I can feel it.

1i94vsy,DD: UiPath ($PATH) - Mispriced and Misunderstood,"I‚Äôm looking for the regardedest, lowest, humblest of you to confirm the way.

* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said PLTR bumpy revenues weren‚Äôt a concern (2022).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said get into Bitcoin before the wall street wave (2017).
* Big brains didn‚Äôt agree when I said Tesla revenues were about to go parabolic (2017).

It‚Äôs true when they say Bears sound smart at parties, but the bulls make money.  Big brains are too smart for their own good, blowing up fears in their minds.

Why do I even posts?  Selfishly, to have a record (Reddit post history) of being right.  I love looking back and saying yep, yep, yep and laughing at big brains while wiping my ass with cash.  I didn‚Äôt go to Harvard or work for a big firm. I have a chip on my shoulder and I‚Äôm here to outclass them all.

So, fellow idiots, I think we have another winner. Time to get hyped.

UiPath ($PATH) $13.86 ($7.617B Market Cap).

**Big brains claim RPA is dead** (https://a16z.com/rip-to-rpa-the-rise-of-intelligent-automation/)

\-	Those pushing AI Agents and claiming RPA is dead are wrong. They assume AI Agents can be developed by skipping straight to step Z, when in reality, they will need to build steps A-Y. AI currently only has a brain. It needs hands and tools connected it to perform real work. UiPath has built out steps A-Y and is ready to take step Z. UiPath is in a position to capitalize on the power of Gen AI.

\-	There‚Äôs a spectrum of automation applications and RPA will still make the most sense in many use cases as the most efficient tool for the job (less processing, lower costs and more energy efficient).  AI Agents will have their place, but UiPath will have a system to orchestrate the spectrum of tools spanning from RPA, hybrid to advanced AI agents.

**Big brains claim UiPath has no moat.**

\-	UiPath‚Äôs product is more differentiated than the market gives them credit for.  The market seems to conflate all RPA vendors as interchangeable, but I believe there are nuanced and important differences between the offerings.  UiPath appears to be the most robust, user friendly and an innovation leader.

Where‚Äôs their moat?

1. Network effects. They have a large install base with 10,000+ customers (easy to upsell clients),
2. UiPath is immune to vendor locking (can automate across many different software provider applications).
3. Preferred vendor/partner to major consulting companies (EY, Deloitte, Accenture).
4. Existing partnerships with major software companies gives UiPath exposure to potential new customers.
5. UiPath has a large base of experienced RPA developers that prefer to use UiPath and who are likely to recommend it where they go.
6. Founder led.  Founder is a product focused engineer, not a career executive playing politics in a bureaucracy. This allows UiPath to be nimbler and seize market opportunities as they arise.

**Big brains claim UiPath‚Äôs growth story is over.**

\-	Gen AI can have a similar effect on UiPath as it did on Palantir and their AIP product. Gen AI will make the existing UiPath platform exponentially more powerful, meaning more and higher value use cases. As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate.

**Big brains have beaten this stock to death.**

\-	This stock is down from all time highs at $85.12/share in 2021 to less than $14/share today.

\-	Big brains seem to be discounting UiPath‚Äôs potential at a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.275x. SAAS companies can easily trade between 10-20x.

\-	UiPath has $1.6B in cash and $0 debt.

\-	82% gross margins.

\-	113% net dollar retention

\-	On the verge of flipping profitable.

\-	Guidance from last earnings call, they said ARR is expected to stabilize and free cash flow to accelerate.

TLDR:

My bet is UiPath has a greater than 50% chance for growth reacceleration.

UiPath product differentiation will become more apparent in the future.

As UiPath AI agent use cases are shared with the world, their sales will accelerate. (i.e. similar to PLTR with AIP).

None of this is financial advice. I may or may not know what I‚Äôm doing.

1i3w2p9,I Paper Handed My Way Out of Scoring Nearly $200k in TSLA Puts Today,"TL:DR; I am a paper handed bitch and even though I made $3k, I am still an idiot.

Introduction: I have been very lucky this year playing puts and calls. I am already up over $103k since 1/1 and I have the receipts. (See my post history for some) So cry me a river indeed.

[Year to date gains in Etrade of $103k for 2025.](https://preview.redd.it/4vqv7g2chnde1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fa24697a1b42441ea4e3fbf31d43befc36709cb)

Nearly every single play has been buying puts when things seem irrationally high, or buying calls when they've fallen too far? What is too far? Good question. But to play this, you need volume and volatility.

$CEG (Constellation Energy Group) has been the perfect trade for that this year. Four times on three separate days I've bought puts on their frothiness. Yesterday I made $20k off $CEG in about an hour. Good work if you can get it.

[CEG Puts have gotten me $35k in gains even though the stock is up.](https://preview.redd.it/qemqizdvhnde1.png?width=1301&format=png&auto=webp&s=5152767c694055798a43636ece96772a6b02faa4)

So that brings us to today. It's Friday, 0 Day Expiration party time! This morning, lots of things are green, and meme stock Elon plaything Tesla is blowing up like a SpaceX rocket over the Carribean. I am ready to make a killing. It's up 5% from the previous day and, if my results this year are right, it's going to go down. Everything returns to the mean. Nothing finishes at the high of the day.

So I buy 200 Put options for $1.24 at $430. It's a $25k bet and my account is ready.

[TSLA looking frothy midway through the day as I buy puts at 430.](https://preview.redd.it/k67m63joinde1.png?width=464&format=png&auto=webp&s=47da208c002804913328eb67a5dc5b96ba08f465)

But it doesn't go down right away. This is fine, I tell myself as the stock goes up to 436, 437... So I decide to double down and buy 150 put options for $1.46 at $435. It's a $22k bet. I've now got $47k on the line, about half my gains on the year. If the stock traces back to $430, it'll be great. $425 would make serious coin.

But I forgot Tesla stock is fucking insane and every regard in this sub is jerking it to this chart.

[TSLA nears $440 with an hour left in trading and I am seriously boned.](https://preview.redd.it/bph2h3o8jnde1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa161caad811a9726e6aae0d48320d99b096a05)

At this point, I have the live chart on my screen and I know I am going to eat shit and be down more than $40k and wipe out everything I've scammed for this year. Every time it comes down to 437, it goes back up to 439. 438. 439. 438. Stupid TSLA.

But wait! With an hour left it starts to fall, just like I thought it would. To $434 at least. My second buy is green more than $10k while my first one is pretty much toast. Every tick up or down is the worst. With less than an hour ago the flip flopping continues. $432. Back up to $433. I realize I am up $21k on one put and down $17k on the other put. I panic sell both and leave with $3k gains. Survival! I was stunned any dork bought my obviously dead put with minutes left.

So what happens? $TSLA crashes (of course) all the way to $426.50 at end of day. I was right.

[End of day: $TSLA at $426.5 after hitting $439 intraday](https://preview.redd.it/l2459uecknde1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=74e4ed83b0c3897783421e490ef372230d2d2177)

So let's do the math on those puts:  
$435 - $426.5 = $8.5 \* 150 \* 100 = $127,500  
$430 - $426.5 = $3.5 \* 200 \* 100 = $70,000

I would have cleared $197,500 instead of $3,200 because I was a paper handed bitch and didn't want to lose $47k. This is the worst $3k I've ever made. FML. ",2025-01-18 01:14:11,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1i3w2p9/i_paper_handed_my_way_out_of_scoring_nearly_200k/

* Company makes infrastructure for AI workloads at extremely impressive efficiency levels. Proprietary configuration for GPU clusters (first in NA to complete in Q1), has efficiency levels and compute performance beyond that of Tesla's latest creation, which NVDA Jensen said described as remarkable. Tip of the iceberg
* $700 mil invested by NVIDIA, who is supplying H100 Hopper GPUs for their cluster models with the first being constructed in KC, with plans to integrate Blackwell GPU H2 2025.
* Minimal debt totaling $27mil with a near $2bil in cash, $1bil+ planned infrastructure development in 25', with ARR forecast of $750m-1b

Primary focus is not some unremarkable data processing system that every SV chump and his grandma are pushing down throats. Nebius was sitting on some already profitable infrastructure in Finland and decided they could expand, replicate and improve across Europe and North America.

They were able to secure listing on the NASDAQ, and quickly obtained a $700 mil investment from Nvidia. Contrary to the few posts from your normal run of the mill bullshit like Motley fool etc..., this part on it's own is actually meaningless. Companies the size on Nvidia throw hail mary's at startups all the time and don't blink when they fail. However, in the context of their lofty development goals, this was their entry point to securing the hardware they needed to succeed, of which there is a finite supply.

Nebius plans to house 35,000 GPU's upon completion of the KC facility (20,000 by year end), utilizing the latest and incredibly efficient NVIDIA H200 GPUs

Alongside this, their facility in Finland is getting an overhaul and expansion, and a new facility will be constructed in Paris.

This is early days, P/S incredibly low in the peer group, which is insane considering the ridiculous multiples on all of the other shit doing nothing in this space. Industry trends are a massive tail wind. If they stay true to growth projections it's only a matter of time before it balloons, and Q1 is an excellent test of their reliance and ability to meet targets.

They received their first buy rating today from some garage shop trying to play wallstreet dress-up, but institutional money is going to be eyeing this closely, and they have an added advantage of their global footprint for managers looking to reposition this far into the secular bull.

As far as revenue goes, they reported $43 million in Q3 2024. They anticipate ARR to surpass $700 mil by year end. If we want to keep valuations reasonable relative to peers, this company should be valued well above 15 billion by year end, making a $65 share price entirely reasonable as the market plays catch-up.

While searching for appropriate contracts, I discovered zero liquidity on every prominent strike from this week until 2027. On Jan 9th open interest spiked an hour into close across most 40, 45, and 50 strikes. Begun building a position here and will continue to do so as I raise cash.

1i17nln,New research note from Damo: Up to 100% bullish on Tesla to $800!,"Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target on Tesla from $400 to $430 (8.93% bullish vs. current price) and set a new bullish scenario valuation of $800 (100% bullish vs. current price). The stock index increase was primarily driven by Tesla's progress in self-driving car (AV) technology and its integration of embedded AI. ,

The report notes that Tesla's unique combination of expertise in data collection, robotics, energy storage, and AI/computing infrastructure puts it at the forefront of the emerging self-driving mobility market.

The analysts emphasize the role of Tesla's Travel Services division, the company's self-driving carpooling business, which is valued at $90 per share in a revised sum-of-the-parts valuation (SOTP) model. The travel services fleet size is expected to grow to 7.5 million vehicles by 2040, with projected revenue per mile of $1.46 and EBITDA margins of 29%„ÄÇ

  
Morgan Stanley also emphasized the growing importance of Tesla's Network Services, which covers recurring revenue streams such as Fully Self-Driving (FSD), Supercharging, and software upgrades.

The network services division is expected to contribute about one-third of Tesla's total EBITDA by 2030, with that percentage rising to nearly 60% by 2040. The Network Services division is currently valued at $168 per share, reflecting its growing importance in Tesla's business model.

We are raising our price target to $430 from the previous $400, an adjustment driven by increased valuation of travel services and network services, partially offset by lower valuation of the third-party battery business,‚Äù the analysts wrote.

They note that Tesla has a lot of potential in embedded AI, including opportunities in aerospace, marine, and other areas, though these have not yet been factored into this valuation.



Analysts expect Tesla's fleet of unmanned self-driving cars to debut in urban environments by 2026. However, in their Tesla Travel Services forecast, self-driving cars are not expected to achieve mass deployment until after 2030.

While self-driving policy may be reassessed at the national level once a new administration takes office, the analysts added that Tesla still faces 'significant hurdles' in overcoming the technical, testing and licensing challenges associated with near-term commercialization.

The updated bullish scenario of $800 per share assumes a fleet size of 12 million vehicles by 2040, revenues of $1.50 per mile, and EBITDA margins of 45%. This scenario foresees strong international expansion and greater pricing power.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley's bearish scenario is valued at $200 per share (49% bearish compared to the current price), reflecting potential headwinds such as stricter regulation and slow market expansion.

1hypjna,The beginning of a Bear Market,"Since the beginning of 2025, the market has been crashing and in fact in started in December of 2024

Watching the history of the VIX we are currently at the beginning of a cyclical and with the turn of events lately, we are set for a real turn in the market by the beginning to end of next week. Short Term ETF VIXY 50MA is about to test the 200MA. Tesla vehicles being recalled and EV sales down down. BoFA no longer sees rate cuts coming in the upcoming years. Blackrock is almost down 10% so far. Yields are up. California is on fire, and in big trouble with the 2nd biggest city economy in the world threatened to be burned down. The busiest freeway in the world is shutting down due to these fires happening and on the lowend earlier today, the costs were estimated to be 20+ billion USD. If the fire does not stop by the end of this weekend the costs could effectively cost California over $1.5 Trillion. Power will be shutoff temporarily for the surrounding areas around LA causing for concerns for public safety. Bankruptcies are definitely expected to increase and while the politics and worldwide conflicts take over the media this upcoming week, LA is at risk of going up in smoke. 

All this being said, it is already the most devastating fire in US history and people will lose their home over a force of nature. As of the time of this post, only 8% has been contained so far. Be prepared and be ready as the market has already  shown signs of cracks and will create issues in the upcoming months. I'm definitely not the first to say anything about this but figured I'd let a few Tards know.

1hv91vx,The current U.S. stock market valuation has reached 2000 and 2021 levels.  Will this time be different?,"Three different U.S. stock market valuation models (the Buffett Indicator, CAPE ratio, and Mean Reversion Model - three different ways of objectively looking at the overall valuation of the current market) are flashing extreme overvaluation warning signs that were both last seen in 2000 and 2021.  Both 2000 and 2021 marked market euphoria highs, and bear markets followed.  You can make all your jokes that you want about gay bears successfully calling 420 of the last 69 recessions or what not, but the undeniable fact is that the track record of these three valuation models showing ""strongly overvalued"" in unison is 2 for 2 in ""calling"" bear markets that followed very quickly.  Will history repeat itself again?  Or is this time different (i.e. - valuations continue to ""not matter"" for longer)?

[Buffett Indicator \(ratio of U.S. stocks total market cap to GDP\) - Strongly overvalued \(2 standard deviations above historical trendline\).  Just like it was in 2000 and 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/gngm7i231abe1.jpg?width=1680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e03e76ec35654e8eea252751c28f6684f66ae4e)

\-

[Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings \(CAPE\) Ratio - Also strongly overvalued.  Tied with 2021, but a bit less \\""deviant\\"" than it was in 2000.](https://preview.redd.it/pvwgetg1w9be1.jpg?width=1664&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca3c67e0787a248277f1b620ed01bed7281a69ca)

\-

[S&P 500 Mean Reversion Model - Strongly overvalued - tied with 2000 and 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/4uxqj2gxz9be1.jpg?width=1662&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25951a195b5363c0b4476b25963d206e5d51d7f0)

There is also a fourth model - the Interest Rate Model, which measures S&P 500 valuation relative to current 10-year treasury rate.  It hasn't quite hit the ""strongly overvalued"" line (it didn't in 2021 either), but it is pretty close to it.

[Interest Rate Model - Not quite to the \\""strongly overvalued\\"" red line, but close.  Lower than it was in 2000, but higher than it was in 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/32sl4e1o4abe1.jpg?width=1660&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dedfffde7edc549734c8c0747c3e3356ceba79bb)

Two recession risk models - Yield Curve Inversion and the Sahm Rule - may be signaling a rough time as well.

[Yield Curve - The 10-Year to 3-Month treasury spread, after big and long inversion, looks like it may be uninverting now.  Historically, recessions or bear markets followed soon after the uninversion.](https://preview.redd.it/iuek8qe66abe1.jpg?width=1651&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b11f04747d4069dc6305dbe7d8a631243308b2b8)

\-

[Sahm Rule value - a measure of the current 3-month moving average of unemployment compared to the prior 12-month low of that same stat.  It poked just above the red line, then retreated a bit.  Right now it is kind of in \\""Will it or won't it?\\"" mode.](https://preview.redd.it/hjkkkzdt8abe1.jpg?width=1673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0151bc58c63c00c2c482642dc2df0f2be53e2173)

\-

There is also the Fed Funds Rate. It is showing a similar setup to previous cycles of rate hikes, followed by rate holds, followed by rate cuts, followed by recession.  The current setup looks similar to 2007-2008 especially.  Will the recession or bear market be cancelled this time with ""mission accomplished - soft landing achieved""?

[Fed Funds Rate - 2007-2008 looks pretty similar to now.](https://preview.redd.it/1w999tosaabe1.jpg?width=1715&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f016a2cda57106d33d7f0b85e303a8199bdb4d6f)

Here is the inflation-adjusted S&P 500 on a log scale chart.  It has historically gone through a series of ""hot"" periods where the market beats inflation for roughly 15 years (give or take a few years), followed by ""cold"" periods where the market loses to inflation that last 10 years (give or take a few years).  The magnitude and time length of the current ""hot"" period looks like it could be giving way to a ""cold"" period soon if the overall historical cycle is followed.

[Inflation adjusted S&P 500 - Are we entering a cooling period soon?](https://preview.redd.it/p82of78idabe1.jpg?width=977&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da3a49111a2c512564846f330f2053baaa628f2c)

Last but not least, I'll list a few informal ""Can't you just feel it it in the room?"" type ""blow-off top"" indicators of a potential market top:

1. Tesla stock doubled in price in like 1-2 months on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  An insane $750 billion market cap to an even more insane $1.5 trillion market cap in 1-2 months on a company earning roughly $13 billion annually (132 P/E ratio right now) and not growing much anymore.  Ludicrous.  Earnings have not exploded in line with stock price, not nearly at all.  I don't care what you TSLA lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
2. Palantir stock also doubled in price in like 1-2 months, also on shallow narratives not backed by numbers.  Roughly $100 billion to $180 billion market cap with a price-to-SALES ratio going from an insane 30x to an even more insane 67x.  Ludicrous.  And I don't care what you PLTR lovers say - your stock valuation is insane and offers no fundamental upside even with pricing in your optimistic assumptions about future growth.
3. *\[Removing this point from discussion because AutoMod thought I was breaking rule #8, even though I wasn't.  I pasted it down in the comments section* [*HERE*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hv91vx/comment/m5ssco9/)*.\]*
4. Just the mentality of too many market participants buying ponzi-scheme like assets or money-burning trash companies at all in general, often knowingly.  Like, seriously, why is this even a thing?  What the fuck is wrong with this market?  This shouldn't be happening... like, at all.
5. The great momentum chase of 2024. The theme of the year was to just bid up and crowd into the most popular meme-like line-go-up assets, regardless of fundamentals.  It went into over-drive in November/December, to the point of self-parody.  It has a very end-stage bull market feeling to it.
6. The great AI hype.  Does the potential future of AI justify many of these extreme valuations?  Maybe, but I'm not convinced that there's much upside left near-term.  The only companies making serious money from this so far are Nvidia and the handful of companies selling the AI hardware to other companies that are speculating on it.  And the once rapid progression in generative AI chatbots, picture generators, and video generators seen in 2023 and early 2024 seems to have slowed and hit a bit of a wall in the second half of 2024.

TL;DR - All the warning signs of extreme overvaluation and an incoming bear market are there.  Unlike most other gay bear posts that usually just show one ""warning sign"" chart to make a case, I showed you multiple charts, along with multiple observations.  Whether you choose to ignore them or not depends on how long you think the market will choose to ignore them or not.

Positions: (1) Bent over a table.  (2) Puts on TSLA, PLTR, MSTR, and some other 2024 momentum clown stocks for 2025. Contemplating whether to inverse or to inverse my inverse.

Update: 1/7 Pre-market - I have taken down the screenshot of my tentative positions from 1/6, because I will be closing some of them and changing some things around.  For archival purposes, you may view my original 1/6 positions [here](https://i.imgur.com/J0orM1x.jpeg).

Update: 1/6 7:00PM EST - Cramer on his closing segment on ""Mad Money"" just said ""I think Palantir and Tesla stock are DEFINITELY going higher.""  Take that for what you will.  I know the meme is to inverse Cramer, but he does end up being right short-term a number of times, so it doesn't really make me any more confident in my puts.",2025-01-06 20:33:24,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hv91vx/the_current_us_stock_market_valuation_has_reached/
1huxcne,"""New"" Volkswagen Leaks ","Alright degenerates, strap in because this is why Volkswagen might just be the juiciest short of 2025. Spoiler alert: this makes Dieselgate look like a warmup.

My Position: Just opened a -0,4 Delta 80‚Ç¨ put on Volkswagen (Vz.) for 5000 ‚Ç¨ expiring 19th June 26.

The Chaos Computer Club just (27.12.24) just revealed that Volkswagen (and its subsidiaries Audi, Seat, Skoda) exposed the real-time locations of *800,000 EVs*. That's right ‚Äì anyone with basic skills could pinpoint where your $40k EV is parked, plus grab your name and contact info. VW literally left their cars and customers wide open for anyone to exploit. Volkswagen‚Äôs software arm, Cariad, stored all this sensitive data on Amazon Web Services without proper encryption or safeguards. Let me say that again: **no encryption in 2025.** That's amateur hour for a company that sells millions of cars. Oh, and this isn‚Äôt the first time VW screwed the pooch on tech; their software track record is *garbage.*

*Here is the link to their video:* [*https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-volksdaten-von-volkswagen#l=eng&t=0*](https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-wir-wissen-wo-dein-auto-steht-volksdaten-von-volkswagen#l=eng&t=0)

**Why This Is Bigger Than Dieselgate**  
Dieselgate cost Volkswagen over $30 billion in fines, lawsuits, and buybacks. But that was *emissions*. This? This is **personal data** ‚Äì names, locations, potential stalking targets and members of the BND. We‚Äôre living in the post-GDPR era, where the EU doesn‚Äôt play nice with data breaches. Fines for mishandling data can be as high as 4% of annual global turnover, which for VW could mean billions. Plus, the reputational damage.

**There has not yet been a Market reaction to the release of this video.**

Also want to give you some reasons why you should not take my advice and short VW:

* Volkswagen is the biggest EV player in Europe with about 25% market share. European people don‚Äôt trust Chinese vehicles, and they don‚Äôt trust Elon Musk.
* VW is grossly undervalued compared to Tesla. We‚Äôre talking ‚Ç¨44 billion market cap vs. ‚Ç¨1,279 billion for Tesla. VW currently earns those ‚Ç¨44 billion every four years.
* CCC did responsible disclosure, and VW already fixed the breach. It will be hard to prove harm done to you.
* The German state is highly invested in VW
* EU regulations require automakers to collect and process vast amounts of data to comply with emissions standards, safety protocols, and EV monitoring. The breach highlights shortcomings, but some responsibility lies with the regulatory framework.

1ht6olt,$250 into $2700 in one day Tesla 0 DTE $400 calls... could of been 10k if I hadn't sold any until close.  ,"Bought calls around 1 hour after open on the dip.  Tesla started coming back and then never really stopped going up.  Could have held on for bigger gains as these options closed at $10 aka $1000 had I been a bit more aggressive but profits can disappear very quickly on 0dte options if the stock reverses.  First went to $2 and then back down to .65 cents... then rocketed back up to $2 and above.   Wish I hadn't sold any early on but who knew Tesla would be up 9% today.  Kinda figured Tesla was in for a reversal after it getting smoked for $100 from the ath few weeks ago and then the huge move down yesterday from delivery numbers.  But either way got a bit lucky with the overall market going up and didn't worry crazily about the position since it was such a small initial max  risk of $250.

1hs7tq9,Sold these naked TSLA calls at the peak. How can I search options that fit a similar profile?,"Sold these naked TSLA calls at the peak. How can I search options that fit a similar profile?

Got lucky as sold these risky options at the peak of TSLA a few weeks ago. I didn't analyze the Greeks or anything other than seeing that the price would have to go up considerably after an already huge run to lose money. 

My question is how can I retroactively analyze these to see what the Greeks looked like or what the conditions were that aligned with my intuition. 

Most likely this was just luck , but I'd like to get more into option selling to profit from theta/vega. 

These felt like absolutely free money and went positive immediately. 

My logic was that the stock was up 100% in a month. High vol, the company is clearly overvalued, and over 1 trillion in market cap. If I were to take major loses on these, Tesla would have to add another trillion in market cap in the next few months. I didn't see that happening.

1hibs0s,"Nvidia Will Be the next Intel, Why I'm bearish long term. TSMC is the true winner(assuming China doesn't invade)","Right now, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta are all spending more than Nvidia on R&D and are developing their own AI chips. Tesla, and AMD are also developing AI chips. Right now, tech companies are only buying Nvidia's chips to get started and build market share, because they do not want to fall behind their competition. 

Using Nvidia's chips at current prices is not profitable, even successful AI companies such as OpenAI fail to achieve positive operating margins despite a highly popular product with paid features. Large tech companies are reluctantly buying Nvidia's hardware to avoid falling behind their competition in market share. But relying on Nvidia long term is never the intention, these companies need to be profitable eventually, Nvidia is just there to get them started.

The thing is, Nvidia's 74.56% gross margin is a strength, but its also a vulnerability. It demonstrates that any AI company that can cut out Nvidia can significantly reduce their costs, and that's why everyone is building their own chips. They don't need to be faster than Nvidia to succeed, they just need to be fast enough to provide services at a lower cost, which is quite a low bar. Developing new products takes time, which is why Nvidia's windfall has lasted. But give it 1-3 more years and you'll start to see the impact on Nvidia's sales.

With everyone rushing to develop their own chips, and all of them relying on TSMC, TSMC has the true windfall. They will certainly be able to hike their prices on wafers due to increased demand, which will hurt Nvidia's margins.

Intel was once a dominant and unstoppable player in the semiconductor space, but then they got too comfortable and started spending their cash flow on dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting in R&D. We see how that played out, with AMD catching up and stealing market share, and now Intel is struggling. No moat is impenetrable.

Nvidia is following in Intel's footsteps with their $50 Billion stock buyback plan at 50x earnings. Despite facing competition from the largest tech companies with deep pockets, they are spending their record windfall just to buy back less than 2% of their shares outstanding. This will be their downfall. They are not hedging their reliance on TSMC by seeking to acquire or develop their own fab business, they are not increasing R&D sufficiently to stay ahead of their competition. This will be their downfall.

In 5-10 years, Nvidia will almost certainly have thinner margins and less market share in the AI space as their customers develop their own in-house solutions. At best, Nvidia will be relied upon for niche applications where performance is essential.",2024-12-20 04:24:32,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hibs0s/nvidia_will_be_the_next_intel_why_im_bearish_long/

1hfembg,Tesla Bull and Bear case: the great AI and liability gamble,"Tesla stock has seen a meteoric rise recently, nearly doubling to $1.4T market cap in just three months. The catalyst is Trump‚Äôs victory and Elon Musk‚Äôs instrumental role in it. Investors expect Elon‚Äôs influence to relax regulations, clearing the way for a robotaxi rollout‚Äîa potential game-changer for the automotive industry and transportation infrastructure as a whole.

Tesla is trading like an AI startup, and for good reason: its ‚ÄúFull Self-Driving‚Äù (FSD) system is at the heart of the valuation. But investors are making several assumptions that warrant a closer look.  


# The Bull Case: Tesla‚Äôs data volume

Tesla has a massive data advantage. With over 4 million vehicles on the road, each equipped with a suite of cameras, Tesla‚Äôs fleet constantly collects real-world driving data. This data acts as a ‚Äúshadow trainer‚Äù for its AI, gathering insights in every imaginable driving condition. Meanwhile, FSD subscribers are essentially paying to supervise the AI, providing Tesla with even more labeled data.

Behind the scenes, Tesla employs an army of data labelers to prioritize edge cases‚Äîrare and tricky driving scenarios. Tesla combines supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning to continuously refine its AI. More importantly, Tesla‚Äôs massive data funnel gives it a clear edge in data volume, which usually means better machine learning.On top of this, Tesla‚Äôs vision-only approach‚Äîusing cameras without lidar‚Äîmakes its system cheaper and theoretically more scalable. The result? A system that could be deployed anywhere in the world, not just pre-mapped areas.





# The Bear Case: Quantity vs. Quality

More data is not always better, and it‚Äôs possible that Tesla might reach a plateau. Teslas are mostly driven in suburban and highway environments, where edge cases are relatively rare, while Waymo trains their AI in dense, chaotic urban areas.¬† The result is a more diverse dataset that‚Äôs constantly evolving.

Waymo is owned by Alphabet (Google‚Äôs parent company) and has been operating fully autonomous L4 robotaxis in large cities since 2018. It uses both cameras and lidar.¬† Combining 2D and 3D data in this way is something Tesla initially set out, but failed, to do.¬† Elon has said that the lidar data was hard to make sense of, since it often conflicted with the vision data.¬† But Waymo has somehow managed to make it work.¬† This means that its data is much richer in quality.¬† The urban-focused fleet also encounters far more edge cases than Tesla‚Äôs suburban-heavy dataset, giving its AI a potentially richer training environment.

The geofencing that Tesla bulls dismiss as a crutch is actually a strategic advantage for Waymo. By limiting its operations to pre-mapped areas, Waymo minimizes liability and achieves Level 4 autonomy with real-world deployments today. Tesla, by comparison, is still at Level 2, which means drivers must supervise and be ready to intervene. Moving from L2 to L4 isn‚Äôt just an incremental step‚Äîit‚Äôs an order-of-magnitude leap in complexity.

Tesla bulls overlook the difference between urban vs. suburban environments. Waymo trains its AI in the most chaotic environments‚Äîplaces like San Francisco and New York City. Tesla‚Äôs FSD, by contrast, collects much of its data in relatively predictable suburban and highway conditions. Cities provide more edge cases, such as jaywalking pedestrians, aggressive lane merges, and unexpected construction detours.

As the saying goes, ‚ÄúIf you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.‚Äù If Waymo‚Äôs AI can survive the chaos of Manhattan or downtown LA, it‚Äôs far more likely to handle less complex environments like suburbs or rural highways. In contrast, Tesla‚Äôs suburban data might create a ‚Äúsame-shit-different-day‚Äù scenario, where the AI becomes great at average cases but struggles with rare, high-stakes scenarios.

# Regulatory relaxation is a double-edged sword

If Musk succeeds in relaxing regulations, Tesla might clear the path for robotaxi deployment. In theory, this could limit Tesla‚Äôs liability, especially if passengers are required to sign release forms. However, accidents involving unsuspecting third parties (e.g., pedestrians) remain a significant risk. Under current frameworks, manufacturers are liable for autonomous vehicles, meaning Tesla could face infinite exposure, even for a small number of accidents.¬† Even if Musk changes the regulatory framework, courts ultimately determine liability, and his involvement could be seen as a conflict of interest at best, complicity at worst.

Tesla‚Äôs data suggests FSD already outperforms human drivers in safety metrics‚Äîwhich is very impressive. However, publishing accident rates also acknowledges that FSD causes accidents. They currently get away with it because, again, L2 puts the onus on the driver.  But it's a different story if they deploy robotaxis as L3 or L4. In that case, any accident caused by FSD is the onus of Tesla, exposing them to unlimited liability.

# The scalability myth

Tesla bulls often criticize Waymo‚Äôs reliance on lidar as costly and unscalable, but this argument doesn‚Äôt hold weight for two reasons.¬† First, lidar is becoming much cheaper, and with volume production, costs could approach Tesla‚Äôs camera-only system.¬† Ironically, Elon‚Äôs first principles philosophy should be applied here: just because something was a certain way before doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be that way.¬† Secondly, the market for taxis in general is urban.¬† When was the last time you saw one in a random suburb or the countryside?¬† Waymo only needs a few major cities to succeed, giving it a more focused path to profitability.



# Tesla vs. Waymo is really Tesla vs. Google

Waymo uses millions of AI-generated simulations to train its system. It‚Äôs AI teaching AI, similar to how AlphaGo and AlphaZero were trained. Tesla may also use simulations, but Waymo‚Äôs superior compute power (via Google‚Äôs custom TPUs) means it‚Äôs clearly dominant in this regard.

Tesla bulls often cite Elon‚Äôs dismissal of lidar and geofencing as evidence of Tesla‚Äôs superior approach. But they overlook Google‚Äôs hegemony in AI.¬† They were in the game before anyone.¬† They delivered AlphaGo, AlphaFold, and many other paradigm-shifting, world-changing products, backed by custom hardware and massive compute resources. Tesla‚Äôs Dojo may be promising, but it‚Äôs still a newbie.  
  


# tl;dr

Tesla‚Äôs $1.4T valuation rests on its perceived lead in autonomous driving, which is to say its lead in AI.¬† If Tesla dominates AI, the stock might still be undervalued. But the data quantity vs. data quality, liability risks, and Waymo‚Äôs technical advantages suggest Tesla may be actually falling behind.  In which case, it's vastly overvalued.

1hf6ic6,One thing I learned this year is to just trust my gut‚Ä¶,"I started late  and researched a bunch of stocks, palatir, soundhound, nvidia when it was still 200-300 pre split, Sofi, Lunr, Tesla at 200 in June July, the list goes on. I bitched out on everything because I have such tight funds and was worried of losing anything and now I‚Äôm looking at the year in review and my paper trades for those companies and I am KILLING MYSELF.

Any personal advice for continuing and not getting discouraged feeling like I am not gonna pick well again? 

Edit: didn‚Äôt expect this to really get attention and maybe only a couple replies not be on the front page? 

But thanks to everyone who gave me words of wisdom whether hard to hear or not. 

I‚Äôm just grateful for lessons and knowledge and perspective, stories etc; since I‚Äôm still a beginner and determined to learn this. 

Edit 2: To be clear I mean Trusting my gut based on charts, stats, earnings, valuation, market cap, growth potential, net operating income Etc. actual numerical data and news. 

I‚Äôm not just saying Ooooo that looks good I got a good feeling about this one! 

No that‚Äôs actually just roulette and I‚Äôm not tryna live like that. 

Also a big reason I didn‚Äôt take the risks is because money is so damn tight and I was trying to have more capital for making decent investments as opposed to smaller or less likely contracts; or shares for things I thought would maybe give me some return on now but probably still had some time or that I didn‚Äôt have enough to make more than a 10s of dollars on. so I did the safer thing. Not asking for sympathy not tryna have dick measuring contest. I Just wanted advice for when I‚Äôm on the cliff thinking about jumping.

These regulations permit the use of highway pilots, allowing drivers to disengage from active control on highways, provided they can resume control when prompted. Additionally, driverless vehicles are authorized on designated routes approved by cantonal authorities, with oversight from a central operator.

1hb6wj6,$RIVN is the new $CVNA ,"Let‚Äôs do a concise yet precise DD on this turd machine called $RIVN. 

I don‚Äôt want to go into too much details because I feel lazy as fuck and you‚Äôll eventually just yolo your money into some stupid short term option that will make you feel like you‚Äôre doing crack while going to $0. Burp. 

Bullish points 

- Gen 2 has a much more cost efficient build that was made very clear by CEO during last earning call. He even said ‚ÄúBlock the noise, we are having great progress with our Gen 2‚Ä¶‚Äù. If this turn out to be fake then I‚Äôll short it to $0 because using this terminology means business. If he can‚Äôt deliver or just lied then he toast. 

- The turnaround story must be real, they must be fighting every second of every day to reduce costs and survive. What did this kind of management behaviour gave as a result for $CVNA ? Don‚Äôt start to touch yourself i‚Äôm not done yet. 

- The market sentiment is almost at an all time low, and rightfully so as they navigate a bunch of problems they caused themselves by being kind of moronic. The bet here is that they will improve on that aspect and stop shooting themselves in the foot every 2 minutes. 

- The cars are loved by their owners, this is self explanatory, a great product will always win and everything will be done to avoid seing it disappear. 

- The new cars will be a massive catalyst up to their launch if you have the patience to hold for at least 1 full year. The R2 will be a best seller and will absolutely destroy the market in which it will be competing. I would 100% buy one if I could. 

- The cars are US made and in this case the US manufactures are not just fighting Tesla they‚Äôre fighting China and a tech US company going bankrupt will not fly with the Trump administration. 

Bearish points will be quick, we all know why it‚Äôs a turd 

- Not being gross margin profitable is a crazy achievement for any kind of respected company,  that‚Äôs some new regarded level of regardness. 

- They could fail on everything they‚Äôre trying to accomplish 

- R2 might just be an other turd machine that doesn‚Äôt fit in any market  

- Elon Musk is literally running the country and has people everywhere, maybe he‚Äôll just want to fuck with Rivian even if it‚Äôs a net negative for the US

1hadjii,Quantum Computing Inc is going to crash,"Context: Quantum computing is having its moment. It‚Äôs risky, but could massively disrupt industries in areas like computing, finance and cyber security. But stock market bubbles are forming. 

Quantum computing is probably the most technically difficult industry for analysts to assess. Few people are equipped with an adequate understanding of quantum technologies, which is leading to massive mispricing. 

Quantum Computing Inc is junk

Iceberg Research‚Äôs recent short report covers some of them. They note that the firm has run from one fad to another (chips, ai, computing) and failed at each. They list several misleading claims that they‚Äôve made and withdrawn. The report is damning and raises serious questions about the future of the company, I encourage you all to read it. 

However Iceberg does not go far enough.

https://iceberg-research.com/2024/11/27/quantum-computing-inc-the-phantom-chip-foundry/

They lack talent. Successful quantum innovations requires strong technical knowledge that you really can only come by in either leading universities or megacap firms like google. 

I went through the Linkedin profiles of each of their employees and compared them with their small cap competitors. I tallied up the share of employees that went to an Edu Rank top-100 world universities for Quantum Physics (which is a very broad net), they rank incredibly poorly among it‚Äôs peers - less than a fifth of employees (see picture)*. This is robust to different ranking metrics. Counting only Ivy leagues they come out much worse.

But look, not all employees are on linkedin. And this is the next big underdog? No. 

A large share of their ‚Äútalent‚Äù comes from the Steven‚Äôs Institute of Technology, an unremarkable university in New Jersey (ranked 150+ for Quantum Physics depending on list) 

The company‚Äôs Chief Quantum Officer is Yuping Huang. On first glance he appears to have a prolific publishing history; however, most papers receive low citations and/or he is third, fourth or fifth author. Huang was previously sued by shareholders for breaching fiduciary duties when he merged his previous company with Quantum Computing Inc. Notably he is both a director and employee, which is a big corporate governance redflag (reminds me of Cassava Sciences). 

There is only one independent director with a background in Quantum Physics to provide checks and balance on Huang ‚Äî Dr Javad Shabani. He is not up to the task. His publishing history is mediocre. 

Looking deeper, the Chief Technology Officer Yong Meng Sua, has an even more mediocre publishing history. And has only risen to an Assistant Professor role at Steven‚Äôs. He spends much of his time discussing esoteric computing questions tangential to his work (i.e. the NP=P problem, see their LinkedIn posts)

And finally the Director of the Company‚Äôs chip foundry (Iceberg has raised significant questions about the foundry). Dr Milan Begliarbekov after finishing high school enrolled in a bachelor‚Äôs degree in English literature at Steven‚Äôs, graduated, then immediately enrolled in a physics Phd at Steven‚Äôs. Either he is a savant polymath who is able to pick up grad school physics level math, or a Phd from Steven‚Äôs is worthless. His publishing career is very mediocre. 

These scientists will not crack the major problems stopping widespread commercialization of Quantum tech. Simply compare their publishing records to the founder at Ion-Q (Peter Chapman) or leading quantum scientists at Google, alongside the significant and verifiable technological advancements these companies have made. 

Another clue that something is amiss is headcount. Rigetti has three fold the number of employees. D-Wave six fold. All have similar market cap. What‚Äôs driving value? We‚Äôve established that it‚Äôs not human capital. Iceberg‚Äôs research reveals it‚Äôs not intellectual property or physical capital either. 

So why has it done so well?  Regarded retail investors.

Only 3.3% of Quantum Computing Inc is held by institutional investors (and falling). Compared with ~40% for IONQ. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/qubt/institutional-holdings

The lack of institutional investment while institutional investors are simultaneously clamouring to load up on quantum stocks is a massive red flag. In fact no Wall Street analysts track them. 

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/quantum-computing-qubt-stock-skyrockets-short-sellers-are-lurking

So what happens next? 

The 800% rise in one month is going to attract short selling interest as people realise it‚Äôs junk. The stock will fall back below $1. 

Risk:
If you want to short/buy puts, You can rest assured that the company is not going to suddenly become profitable. The main risk comes from why they‚Äôve done so well, despite having little revenue, expertise, or innovation to show for it.

They‚Äôre literally called Quantum Computing Incorporated. If you‚Äôre a full regard wanting to invest in Quantum computing are you going to invest in IonQ (what?), Rigetti (spaghetti company?) or a company conveniently called Quantum Computing? It‚Äôs a regard trap. 

It‚Äôs like being interested in electric cars and passing on Tesla because you wanted to invest in a stock called Electric Car Co.

I didn't get to post my DD with my YOLO because I failed a ban bet. Also I forgot to put it in the post.

Last week‚Äôs gold event:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab\_channel=Robinhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdFjAhDP3sM&ab_channel=Robinhood)

TLDR: IMO Robinhood is the best stock on the market right now with a great business model and the best team and has the most upside potential, even during a market downturn.

They had 1.5 million gold subscribers at $5/month last year. Now MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 3.2 MILLION.

Robinhood has the potential to become the next trillion-dollar company. Everyone is always looking for the next stock that will have NVDA or TSLA-like growth and I have good reason to believe that Robinhood is the one. Literally a 30-bagger since they‚Äôre at $37 billion, which is NOTHING. For example, about $1 trillion flew out of Nvidia in like a month and Robinhood only needs around $55 billion more to reach $100/share. They actually have a good business model leading the great leap forward in transforming finance with a CEO that is already mainstream. Man is on CNBC last week:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab\_channel=CNBCTelevision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpoKCzJVrU0&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision)

They are going to smash earnings again IMO. Been taking money hand over fist. They already smashed earnings last quarter.

I‚Äôd say that inclusion into the S&P 500 is on the horizon. They just missed it last quarter but I see no reason why they can‚Äôt be in this quarter with a lot of stocks tanking. And we all know what happened when TSLA was put into the S&P 500 with a similarly well-known CEO known as the Elongated Muskrat. ROCKET EMOJI.

Robinhood is overhauling everything with their services, including the use of AI. That‚Äôs right. The AI buzzword. They cap their fees at $250/year for investment advisor systems.

Cash delivery? Bruh I‚Äôm never going to an ATM again:¬†[https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

They have 12 partner banks so FDIC insurance is $2.5 million with them instead of $250,000:¬†[https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/)

Robinhood is now VENMO/Apple Pay. You can send money to people instantly:¬†[https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/banking/)

Robinhood makes money on everything. Options, crypto, and now even straight-up gambling with prediction markets. Even in a terrible market they still make money on fees and subscriptions.

I don't really care about any litigation involving prediction markets and I don't think anyone else does either. Gambling always wins.

Cathie Wood bought like $25 million recently (Now holds 5% of ARKK‚Äôs holdings, TSLA is 11% for reference) and it was given a price target of $105 last week:¬†[https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-maintains-robinhood-outperform-rating-105-target-93CH-3951578)

IRA contribution and 401k transfer match is literally a money magnet.

People will live their entire financial lives through Robinhood. They have high-yield interest rates on uninvested cash and have a debit card. Kind of like how people use WeChat for everything.

They also have a credit card with 3% cash back on EVERYTHING (best on the market from what I‚Äôve seen) = more money.

Great Wealth Transfer putting trillions of dollars in Millennials and Gen Z hands, going straight to RH for gambling, and especially on this sub.

Robinhood is honestly like a 7x leveraged SPY imo. Every time SPY is up 1% Robinhood is up 7%, and vice versa with the same chart pattern. SPY really only needs to go to 570 for HOOD to go to $50 from $42. $50 by the end of the week bc we will get the clarity from the big dude tomorrow.

Easy to use platform.

I am also predicting we have a face-ripping rally on liberation day because no one gives a fuck about tariffs. This is all about selling the rumor and buying the news so we all have certainty. JPOW also speaks Friday so my boy is going to pump it up.

1jjt9qf,Stop buying $TSLA puts,"Hello Regard,

I have consistently been buying $TSLA puts every time it pumps and made decent money but guys, this time it's different. A 13% pump simply due to ""softer tariffs"" makes no sense. $NVDA and the SPY have not been moving like $TSLA this past week. Again, a sudden pump to +4% just before closing is very sus. They are somehow managing to trap the retail virgin. How can a stock skyrocket 13% literally after they announce that they lost 44% sales in Europe? When $INTC reported an 8b loss, it lost 30% valuation in 30 minutes. Intuitive Machine($LUNR) lost 50% valuation because they didn't land something on the moon, idk.

At 3:05PM I noticed a 12M BUY Volume on $TSLA on my Robinhood App. The same thing happened yesterday on closing, someone bought 2M stock. This is not retail investor, This is Elmo and ü•≠ cooking up some massive scam which is going to completely cook the retail investor and us, WSB Put buyers. I have made good money buying $TSLA puts but today I have made the cumulative decision to stay away from them.

1jiqjas,"Volkswagen, BMW group electric cars outsell Tesla in Europe in February","(Reuters) - Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) EV sales in Europe have fallen in February behind legacy brand Volkswagen ([VOW3.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW3.DE),¬†[VLKPF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLKPF)) and the BMW ([BMW.DE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMW.DE)) group, as well as rivals from China, data by research platform JATO Dynamics showed on Monday.

Elon Musk's all-electric brand is facing a loyalty test in Europe after the close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump openly supported far-right parties in the continent, including with at least two dozen posts on his X platform promoting Germany's Alternative fur Deutschland.

Musk's role in politics, rising competition in the EV market and the phasing out of the existing version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, have all impacted sales, Felipe Munoz, Global Analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a report.

""Brands like Tesla, which have a relatively limited model lineup, are particularly vulnerable to registration declines when undertaking a model changeover,"" Munoz said.

Tesla's battery-electric vehicle (BEV) registrations in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland fell on average by 44% from the same month of 2024, to under 16,000 cars sold in February. Its market share in the month fell to 9.6%, the lowest February reading in the last five years.

By comparison, Volkswagen's BEV sales were up 180% to under 20,000 cars, while the BMW brand and BMW-owned Mini, combined, sold almost 19,000 BEVs in February, the data showed.

Chinese-owned brands, combined, also sold more electric cars than Tesla, JATO Dynamics said.

BYD's ([1211.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/1211.HK),¬†[BYDDY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYDDY)) and Polestar's ([PSNY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PSNY)) BEV sales in the same markets were up respectively 94% and 84% to over 4,000 and over 2,000 cars. Xpeng ([XPEV](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XPEV),¬†[9868.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9868.HK)) sold over 1,000 cars and Leapmotor ([9863.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/9863.HK)) almost 900.

BEV sales at Geely ([0175.HK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/0175.HK),¬†[GELYF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF)) -owned Volvo and SAIC ([600104.SS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/600104.SS))-owned MG, instead, dropped by 30% and 67% respectively, the data showed.

Total car sales in 25 European Union markets, the UK, Norway and Switzerland dropped by 3% to 0.97 million in February, while BEV registrations were up by 25%.",2025-03-24 13:22:21,wallstreetbets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-bmw-group-electric-cars-114132432.html

1jhdnw2,Modified Discounted Cash Flow for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI),"Since my[ last post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hgflri/i_let_chatgpt_author_a_financial_model_human/)about TSLA predicted a market correction for the stock (as we are currently seeing as of March 2025), I am back with a different speculation idea for SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI). **I have basically modified the framework of discounted cash flow (DCF) to function in terms of industry multiples.**

Instead of discounting each period's cash flow and adding them up, I decided to discount the net income in each period (using SoFi's cost of equity estimate) instead and then multiply that by the mean P/E ratio estimate for the finance industry, essentially deriving the stock price in today's value for each period of earnings. Finally, I averaged the results to find the price target for SoFi.

**Is this a methodologically correct method of financial modeling? No**, but I believe that this is a way to keep in mind the time value of money when evaluating P/E ratio ahead of today's earnings period.

**My conclusion is that SoFi is underpriced and has a decent upside ahead.** Please be mindful that the model's assumptions are not grounded on a scientific basis. Therefore, changes in assumptions could result in a drastically different conclusion.

Lastly, I understand that the extension of forecasted periods would ultimately result in the target price in future periods converging to zero as the discount factor increases exponentially, so the result I have is also highly dependent on how many forecast periods to include. For good measure, I decided to extend for 5 more years after the member growth is expected to stabilize at 3%.

Divide by 3.22 billion shares and you get the [reported of book value per share](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics/) $22.67. (My calculator says $22.64 but I assume that's a rounding error.)

That $72.913 billion book value comes from $122.070 billion in assets, including $58.360 billion in ""current assets"", less $48.390 billion in liabilities. Now according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_asset):

>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period.

If you look at the details of the balance sheet, the current assets are mostly stuff that would retain its value pretty well in a disaster, stuff like ""cash"" and ""short-term investments"". Strictly speaking if TSLA is holding a one-year bond its value on March 19th might be more or less than it was worth on December 31st, but assuming the value is unchanged isn't the worst assumption. The big exception, AFAICT, is ""inventory"", of which the balance sheet shows $12.017 billion.

Now, if you assume that when TMZ posts that naked Elon Musk video, all Tesla's inventory and all its non-current assets become worthless, yeah that bankrupts the company. But that's pretty clearly a bad assumption. The inventory might have to be marked down, but to $0? Maybe no hypothetical acquirer wants a Cybertruck factory, but factories can be retooled. Placing a market sell for Tesla's $1.076 billion worth of crypto might not return much cash, but presumably an acquirer wouldn't be that stupid. And I'm not an accountant, but ""deferred tax assets"" (valued at $6.524 billion) sound like something an acquirer might value at close to par?

So maybe we mark down Tesla's inventory by half (\~$6.009 billion); we mark down its crypto, which is overwhelmingly Bitcoin, based on how much Bitcoin has declined since December 31st (\~$0.078 billion), and we mark down other non-current assets (excepting deferred tax assets) by half (\~$28.133 billion), which gives us a fire sale value of about $38.69 billion or about $12/share.

I'm a software engineer, not an accountant or investment banker, so someone with more expertise in fundamentals analysis than I could probably come up with a better estimate than $12/share. But the fact remains you probably shouldn't place any bets that depend on TSLA going to $0 by end of next week.

Even though, yeah, fuck Elon.

Anyway, here's my position, which I'm holding today's movement be damned:

So if the company stops selling cars and stops getting money from governments around the world who‚Äôs going to prop it up?

1j9cirg,AI trade simply out of juice or starting to deflate?,"The S&P 500 has had a stellar run for the past couple of years, adding roughly $19T from the ChatGPT moment (Nov '22) to the DeepSeek event (Jan '25). I ran some back of the envelope calculations and, by my estimate, at least half of that is AI-driven!

By AI-driven, I‚Äôm referring to two key contributors:

1. First, the ""picks and shovels"" plays in AI data centers, which contributed $4.5 trillion (24% of the S&P's gains), with NVDA leading the charge, accounting for 69% (nice) of this group's gains. While in my table I‚Äôve focused on some of the major players in this space, it's likely I've left out many others, meaning these figures almost certainly underestimate the full impact.
2. Second, the rest of the Magnificent 7, which have benefited in various ways from the AI narrative, added an additional $5.2 trillion (27% of the S&P's gains).

Now, the big question is: Is the AI trade simply losing some juice, or are we witnessing the start of a full-blown reversal? Since the DeepSeek event, these names have collectively shed $1.3 trillion, suggesting the latter might not be easily dismissed.

What does this mean for the S&P going forward? The rest of the pack will have to pick up the slack if we are to see some gains this year, and that is without even considering the big R word.

Edit: figured out how to add the image.

1j42h15,blackrock made a move on panama ports. they‚Äôre moving on mining/drilling next [DD],"I‚Äôm sure some of you heard the headlines around Panama yesterday. Blackrock announced that they led a group of private investors to purchase[ two of the surrounding ports near the canal](https://www.wsj.com/business/logistics/blackrock-strikes-23-billion-deal-for-ports-on-both-sides-of-panama-canal-d42a5b5e). The president praised the action during his televised address and you can rest assured that no part of this was a surprise to either him or the institutional investors involved in the matter.

You see, Blackrock has been aiming to become a major player in infrastructure and energy transition markets, and [recent major acquisitions in the last few months¬† ](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=blackrock+gip+acquisition)have paved the way to accomplishing that end. I‚Äôve been following them closely ever since I noticed their involvement in the mining, metals, and rare earth sector in Ukraine. I had written a separate \[DD\] explaining why I believe that sector was about to have a massive run [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/)

Presently, I want to bring your attention to the positioning and posturing made by Blackrock, as well as Trump-affiliated mining, metals, and drilling executives, ever since the November election. I believe that we will see similar involvement by that firm in the reconstruction of Ukraine, as well as in supporting mining and processing of rare minerals and metals both in that region and in the USA domestically.

**I. As you sleep, Blackrock buys, then buys, and buys some more**

In previous discussions, I mentioned a number of companies that I believe are uniquely situated to benefit dramatically from private and governmental support in the western rare earth supply chain, especially at mid-stream, including MP materials which is [presently the only american company that is operational in their mining, extracting, and processing of rare earth,](https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3700059/dod-looks-to-establish-mine-to-magnet-supply-chain-for-rare-earth-materials/) especially when it comes to the heavy minerals deemed most essential to our national security.

Would you like to know something curious? [Blackrock acquired a 10% stake of MP](https://fintel.io/so/us/mp) with haste after Trump‚Äôs election. A few days following the election, Gina Rinehart, a mining magnate, Australia‚Äôs richest women, and close friend to the president, also acquired an [8.5% stake of MP](https://fintel.io/i/hancock-prospecting-pty-ltd) through a new investment group created under Hancock Prospecting in Q4 2024.  Rinehart had previously been in discussion with MP materials over a potential merger that would see MP materials and Lynas Rare Earth [(a company that Rinehart has significant ownership in as well](https://www.mining.com/web/australian-billionaire-gina-rinehart-buys-stake-in-rare-earths-producer-lynas/) and which is the largest producer of rare earth outside China) combine forces to create a unified company capable of posing a serious threat to [Chinese stranglehold over the chain](https://www.google.com/search?q=mp+and+lynas+rinehart&client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=b3124e538ea91f17&sxsrf=AHTn8zp30_wTmF7gaP7WD3QbzwF6FDOmDw%3A1741175001245&ei=2TjIZ93gDqeJptQPx7TfoAQ&ved=0ahUKEwidscOr7vKLAxWnhIkEHUfaF0QQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=mp+and+lynas+rinehart&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFW1wIGFuZCBseW5hcyByaW5laGFydDIFECEYoAFI-gdQigFYlAdwAXgAkAEBmAGqAaABnAeqAQM2LjO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgegAsYFwgIFECEYqwKYAwCIBgGSBwMzLjSgB5kY&sclient=gws-wiz-serp). The idea, as far as I know, was that Lynas would wind down operations in Australia and begin significant investments scaling with MP in the United states. This aligns with present administration efforts to support the domestic chain. In fact, Lynas has a contract with the federal government to build a processing plant in the US anyways.

I have to say that convergence between institutions like Blackrock and private equity in recent months in this sector do not stop at MP or Lynas. Here is a list of some companies that I have been interested in within the mining, metals and rare earth minerals sector, as well as the corresponding ownership stake taken by Blackrock and other investors in recent months:

>**MP Materials**: 9.50% Blackrock, 8.5% Rinehart (15% of Rinehart‚Äôs portfolio)  
**UUUU:** 8% Blackrock; Rinehart also invested  
**LAC**: 5% Blackrock; Rinehart also invested  
**TECK**: 6.6% Blackrock, 2% Rinehart (20% of Rineharts portfolio)  
**TTEK -** 9.7% Blackrock, tripled stake in company in February, 2025. Ken Griffin  
**HES -** 8.5% Blackrock; Citadel CEO Ken Griffin also increased his share by ‚Ä¶¬† 26,099,166% üòÇ  
**TSLA** \- 5% Blackrock, Q4 they added more shares of TSLA than any other stock; RH

Blackrock has also quietly been making significant acquisitions of shares of [Endeavour Mining](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/03/03/3035908/0/en/Endeavour-Announces-Holding-s-in-Company.html) as recently as in March 2025 and I have also found institutional support for a number of related sectors, such as VAL for offshore drilling infrastructure.

Rinehart had also invested 7% into an Argentinian Lithium company in Q4, 2025. She appears close with the president of Argentina, actually. They took a selfie together at the inauguration party in DC.

[Rinehart with Argentina's President, Javier Milei](https://preview.redd.it/6dvpy9obcvme1.jpg?width=1092&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccc8573d3792788b629ff2bb29300f702c0497e7)

I wonder if there are any looming partnerships in the works? I bet so.

**II. Rampant Speculation**

The president has promised dramatic action in mining and resource production in the USA in the coming week. He mentioned it on his address to the senate last night. I doubt it was news to the institutionally powerful, though, in the same way that I doubt it is a coincidence that short put interest on MP has been \~12,000 w/ expiry mid-march, [only to then dramatically fall off the cliff for expiry mid-april.](https://fintel.io/sopt/us/mp)¬†

I wonder what will happen? Here is some rampant speculation: MP‚Äôs CEO has reduced his share to a feeble 9.5% stake in the company whilst Blackrock and Rinehart have increased there‚Äôs to match. **I would not be surprised if we see Blackrock, Rinehart/Hancock, and MP working together to dramatically scale USA rare earth production.** This would also fit with language in executive order on minerals and mining, leaning on Quadrilateral Security Partners.

I also found the positioning with LAC particularly interesting given that they are awaiting approval for the largest [north american lithium mine](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/LAC/lithium-americas-increases-mineral-resource-and-reserve-for-thacker-dvrd2ok6wzyj.html). They are also partnered with GM. I wonder how direct private equity investment and further deregulation and government expediting of the usual processes may impact this company, and with what timeline? I think we see movement sooner rather than later, but I‚Äôm just some guy.

Anyways, here are my positions:

1j3bsy2,[DD] Critical Minerals II: The Domestic Supply Chain Strikes Back,"Hi all, this is meant to be a followup to the last \[DD\][ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/). The thesis of that post was:

>**Thesis/Summary:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals.

In this post, I want to go over further developments in my research on this sector and the subsequent adjustments that I‚Äôve made to my portfolio as a result.¬† I‚Äôll start with a bit of methodology. Among the guiding considerations I have found reasonable:

1. Priority should be given to domestic companies looking to mine, refine, and develop critical metals/minerals in the USA or who may be substantial suppliers of our critical minerals stockpile. Secondary priority should be given to companies that are part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or otherwise western-aligned, and wishing to mine, refine, or develop critical metals/minerals in the USA, or who may be stockpile suppliers.
2. Priority should be given to companies that have substantial federal contracts already or have projects presently awaiting government permits, funding, or regulative actions, where such action would be expressly in the USA national security interest.
3. Priority should be given to companies that have institutionally and politically well-resourced members involved in their board, leadership, governing body.
4. Priority should be given to companies represented unusually strongly in the portfolio of major hedge funds, have unusual levels of insider activity, and/or are represented in the financial disclosures of politicians in Washington, D.C.¬†
5. Priority should be given to companies that have established they can deliver results or who have a head start in their particular niche of the industry relative to competitors.

Given this, a lot of my research has presently been focused on evaluating degrees of institutional, political, and insider support for the companies that, *prima facie,* appear to have their interests aligned with the federal government in that the success of the company supports federal objectives.

Specifically, here is what I have done since last writing:

1. I combed through the 2024 financial disclosures of the administration and his various cabinet members to evaluate whether they had considerable equity in this sector and, if so, where.
2. I combed through 13F and NPORT filings from the heavy-hitting hedge funds, investment managers, and so on (e.g. Blackrock, Citadel, ‚Ä¶) to evaluate their posturing.
3. I did research into which companies work with which metals/minerals and where, if any, there are bottlenecks in their growth that may be eased w/ deregulation, federal support.
4. I looked into which individuals, with ties to the mining and metals industry, appear to also be tied to, or otherwise cozy with, the president, or members of his administration. I then looked into their financial disclosures, etc, as well, at least to the extent possible.
5. Wherever I found an investment firm, LLC, etc, that I did not recognize, but which has been making substantial recent investments in this sector and in the companies I have flagged, I went on to also research who was behind them and their affiliations.

Strategies like this can be hampered by the delay between position adjustments and submission of financial disclosures. Hence, this does have its risks. Nonetheless, I found interesting data. For example, when I was looking into MP materials, I noticed substantial **($200 million+)** investments opened Q4 2024 (that is, as of December 31, 2024)¬† by ‚ÄúHancock Prospecting Pty.‚Äù I also noticed the fund was **$2billion+ in total.** I had never heard of this group.¬† Did a little looking into it and it turns out to be managed by [**Gina Rinehart**](https://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/gina-rinehart-revealed-as-owner-of-2b-us-stock-portfolio/)**,** a mining magnate and Australia‚Äôs richest person, who also happens to be close enough with Mangoes hat [she attended his inauguration party in January](https://www.atlasiron.com.au/pratt-rinehart-to-attend-trumps-inauguration/), alongside the usual cabal of tech billionaires and politicians. Look at this[ adorable photo of her](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/be-like-donald-trump-gina-rinehart-tells-nations-leaders/news-story/86084df17ee039ba0c4c963d1be45256?amp) with Argentina‚Äôs president, Javier Milei, who also attended.

As I said, in Q4 2024, Rinehart‚Äôs fund opened substantial new positions, including $200million+ in MP materials. Of the investments I listed in my last research post, the fund also opened up new positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars in TSLA, ALB, others...

I also learned in this past research cycle that the president has investments in companies like UUUU and CAT, that Kash Patel has investments in MP materials and CAT, and that Ken Griffins (Citadel) increased his share in MP materials by 2500% in Q4 (albeit, he also shifted his derivatives b/w the long Call/Put spread he likes to keep on many of his holdings).

[**John Paulson**,](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-05/election-2024-john-paulson-is-raising-43-million-for-trump) a close friend and billionaire supporter of the president, who is perhaps most famous for his bet against the housing market in 2008, which made him $20 billion richer, also has investments in PPTA (Perpetua Resources).

1iuykwm,"the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)","A few days ago, I saw the[ \[DD\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.

Today I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.

**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**

Why does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?

The answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.

[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.

Don‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.

Let me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.

**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**

Alright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.

First, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.

You see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.

If there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.

As if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†

If you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†

What does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù

I recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù

By way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.

Here is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:

>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

Trump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.

Furthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\*\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\*\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.

**Part III: Positions**

Where to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.

Why did I pick these? (don't mind Humana, Uber, VST)

>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.

>**LYS** is AU but part of ""The Quad"" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes ""(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.""

>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration

>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).

>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)

>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: ""(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.""

>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.

>**TLOFF** is nickel, partnered with TSLA

>**ABAT** is US lithium batteries supply/recycling

>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.

I'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:

1ishu2q,$PARA YOLO - Undervalued Giant with Massive Upside Potential,"**Paramount Global ($PARA) is an undervalued giant hiding in plain sight.** The misunderstood fundamentals and exaggerated expectation for the death of traditional media has fueled a shockingly unique opportunity on a company that is fundamentally sound and poised for future growth due to its incredibly strong brands. Despite its negative reputation due to the Shari Redstone mismanagement of M&A and the difficulty that traditional media companies have been facing, $PARA is a massively undervalued media powerhouse with legendary brands in CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Pictures, etc. This company is a media giant trading at fire sale prices. With a laughably low P/S ratio (\~0.24) and EV/EBITDA (\~5x), PARA is far cheaper than its competitors despite looking poised for a recovery, especially with the looming Skydance merger.

¬†

**Fundamentals:**

The fundamentals are honestly simple to me. Paramount has been struggling over the last few years to escape the difficulties that traditional media companies have been facing. They have been ineffective at creating enough revenue and operational efficiency/ focus to make any meaningful impact in their debt since about 2018 when their debt initially exploded upwards. Because of these factors, Wall Street and Retail have both soured on Paramount.

Paramount+ has been relatively successful, but the investment has not justified the returns thus far, however this aspect of their business has been steadily improving. In their last quarterly report, Paramount+ added 3.5M new subscribers, showing that the platform is still bringing in new customers. Beyond this, Paramount has exceptionally strong brands that are not going to die, no matter what comes of the future of media.

To further embolden the case for the intrinsic value hidden within Paramount, here are some of Paramount's Notable Brands: All of CBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, and quite a few more, with all associated brand IP (think SpongeBob, South Park, Avatar, The Daily Show, etc.). Point being, **these are brands that people interact with CONSTANTLY. Hours and hours of attention is spent on these brands each day.** And despite network cable‚Äôs viewership ‚Äúdecreasing‚Äù, CBS is still the #1 channel and rakes in about 4.8ish million viewers per day. Attention is the most valuable commodity in our world. Monetization of the traditional media platforms has been challenging, but with new leadership and the huge investment being made, **I am betting that they see incredible opportunity for growth with this company.**

I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt mention that there are quite a few things that have been stacked against this stock for a long time, most notably the situation with 70% of controlling shares being held by Shari Redstone, who managed the company abysmally and ruined a potentially lucrative buyout for shareholders, making further M&A negotiations chaotic and unpredictable. However, she agreed to sell her control of the company in July of 2024 to Skydance, who will now be controlling the company with their current CEO, David Ellison (the son of Larry Ellison). **Shari being gone and competent leadership coming into the scene is a huge, huge deal. This merger has created a very unique situation for $PARA, which I believe to be a win-win for investors.**

¬†

Honestly, though, all of this is drivel. **What matters to me with the Paramount fundamentals is this**:

*Paramount's Market Cap:* $8B flat

*Paramount's TTM Revenue:* $28.9B

*Price to Book Ratio:* .43

*Price to Sales Ratio:* .24 (compare this to Netflix's PS ratio of 11.76, or even $WBD's of .64)

*EV / EBITDA:* \~5x (compare with Netflix of 17x, Disney \~10x)

The debt situation I have seen so much negative sentiment about online appears to be utterly overblown and I honestly don't see how people think this company is financially dying. Let me sum it up as follows:

*Debt to equity:* .94 (fine)

*Debt to assets:* .34 (good)

*Quick ratio:* 1.10

*Net margin:* \-.06 (trending better, hope this flips positive again soon, but I don't see reason for concern)

QoQ Total and Net Debt has been trending DOWN since Q2 2020

Free cash flow has been stably positive since Q3 of 2023, currently at $762M TTM

*Cash on hand:* $2.44B

Skydance merger will immediately inject $1.5B in capital once closed

There are deep value stocks, then there are‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. you know the rest.

¬†

¬†

**Technicals:**

Getting into the chart it seems evident to me that price has been pushed down about as far as it can be without something fundamentally changing. I like to buy my stocks at lows and sell them at highs (don‚Äôt you?). As you look through my TA, think about whether this price seems like a low or a high to you.

There are 3 timeframes that I will focus on; the monthly, weekly, and daily.

Please note that **current price is $11.30** at the time of writing this post

¬†

*Monthly*

https://preview.redd.it/yb9zabv1jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=26f05db27a086c13828f255c0689bd27baeeef07

Macro Point of Control: $10.66 (price is above)

Macro Fibonacci Golden Pocket: $10.44-$11.68 (price is within and has held as strong support)

RSI: Bounced off bear zone and has been steadily (though slowly) rising since Feb 2024

MACD: Bullish divergence printed Oct 2023, has been steadily green and rising since Feb 2024, signal cross up in Jan 2024

Lastly, volume has been seeing some pretty significant influxes throughout this downtrend it‚Äôs been in since 2021 and volume has been consistently higher during this 4-year trend than it‚Äôs been at really any point since the 2008/2009 market shenanigans. This may indicate accumulation, especially so since 2024.

¬†

*Weekly*

¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/r8rhzvd4jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=475549c3ca26b39b7f689e96e32796ae2050af68

The consolidation in the golden pocket is really beautiful. The fact that you had a significant bounce from the .65 to the .5¬†*exactly*¬†confirms the validity of using fibs on this chart and solidifies this golden pocket range as very strong support.

The weekly Bollinger Bands have squeezed to their 3rd tightest width in the history of this stock, and the narrowest they've been since January of 2018. Generally speaking, tight BBs lead to explosive price breakouts.

MACD and RSI have been printing bullish divergence for 3 years without much, if any, positive price action following. In my opinion this¬†*will*¬†change. Reversal in trend¬†*is*¬†imminent. There is a looming catalyst for this to reverse when the company reports earnings on Feb 26.

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/0tv16j253yje1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef26c06db90cd9260b5f2553edfc3083c08b635

The Weekly ADX is actually beautiful. This is one of the lowest ADX values I've ever seen on a weekly chart for a company as big as $PARA, and it's starting to curl up. Simultaneously DMI+ is going up while DMI- is going down. This looks similar to the ADX setups $TSLA had in October of 2012 before a 535% run, $UPST had in June of 2024 before a 350% run (this one looks the most structurally similar to $PARA in many ways), $COST had in June of 2024 before a 100%+ run, $BABA in Apr 2024 before an 82% run, $INTC in June of 2017 before an 73% run, and $DIS before a 56% run. What I can't find is similar ADX setups that didn't have significant breakouts up or down.

¬†

https://preview.redd.it/ppnb1c0fjxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a4a872f8458bf897d8c5ca09e9899dd67dbf57

And how about a Triple Bottom on the weekly RSI just to further solidify my position of being on the precipice of a bullish breakout. It's not perfect, but chart patterns rarely are, and its close enough to be very intriguing.

¬†

*Daily*

https://preview.redd.it/w0b9k1h63yje1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac18eef8caa65fbfc7c372e9b433b0d49cfa6a11

There are two chart patterns that are completing/ have completed. One is a falling wedge; the other is a pennant. The falling wedge has a price target of approximately $25. The pennant has a price target of approximately $5.26. Do you think it‚Äôs more likely that this company halves in value again, down to a $4b market cap, or *returns to a more reasonable valuation* of \~ $20b market cap?

There are also numerous gaps to the upside on the chart that I expect to be filled once a bullish trend reappears. Gaps are from \~$19-$23, \~$34.50-$36, and \~$85-$91.25.

https://preview.redd.it/xgawv1y73yje1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bb02f718152b2fa47168a6ba1c20bef64b68b7

¬†The last thing that I want to highlight for is that the 50 and 200 daily moving averages are currently in a $0.20 range. There **will** be a golden cross very, very soon if price holds above $11. Algorithmic traders will rush in when this happens.

¬†

To summarize how bullish the technicals are:

1. Consolidating in a macro golden pocket above the point of control
2. Bullish divergence on the monthly MACD
3. 9 touches of bullish divergence on the weekly RSI & MACD
4. Weekly ADX is completely cracked out and looks poised for a **massive** run
5. Weekly RSI has a triple bottom with a very bullish outlook
6. Falling wedge pattern and gaps on the chart point towards a run deep into the $20 range
7. Daily golden cross is imminent if price holds above $11

¬†

**Some fun stuff:**

Short interest is 11% and the Days to Cover is \~13. While this isn't a huge amount in comparison to some previous meme stonks, this is quite significant for a stock the size of $PARA, and the size of this position is exemplified by the days to cover. When I compared this to Paramount‚Äôs competitors, I found that it is 3x-10x the short position of any other company in the sector. Additionally, I pulled the options flow data for the last 9 months to analyze the outstanding bearish premium. What I've found is what I believe to be a ticking time bomb. There is approximately $39M in net bearish put premium that is not closed, and $4M in net bearish call premium. This means that (in my opinion based on my analysis) there is approximately **$43M (22.46M shares worth of contract, or approximately 45% of free float) in net bearish premium yet to be closed**, that, if correct, will dump gasoline on the fire of a run if $PARA begins to break out and these positions are forced to close. These are trades that I believe to be held predominantly by Hedge Funds and institutions, and I believe that they are overexposed on this trade due to the belief that $15 is a price cap until merger. If price reverses and goes beyond the $15 buyout price, a mass unwinding of these positions (both the short positions AND the bearish contracts) will have to take place as the perceived price ""ceiling"" could be shattered.

¬†

*Final point:* \*securing tin foil hat and preparing for berating\* I believe that the options data I analyzed has uncovered a significant arbitrage play that is in the works. This Skydance-Paramount merger arbitrage trade is a ticking time bomb. Someone has been shorting PARA near $15 and hedging with bearish put options, betting that the deal price caps upside. But if PARA breaks and holds above $15, these trades fall apart, causing the holder to potentially cover their position, put holders to unwind, and institutions to scramble to reposition. This could trigger a cascade of buying pressure, breaking the artificial price ceiling and leading to a massive price surge. If the deal is renegotiated or collapses as a result of this price action, PARA could explode MUCH higher.

¬†

**Tldr;**

Paramount Global ($PARA) is an absurdly undervalued media giant that Wall Street has pushed down as far as it can, setting up what I believe to be a uniquely explosive opportunity. Despite owning powerhouse brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and Paramount Pictures, $PARA trades at a laughably low valuation‚Äîits P/S ratio is just 0.24, its EV/EBITDA is \~5x, and it‚Äôs generating $28.9B in revenue on an $8B market cap. Meanwhile, short interest sits around 10% (\~12+ days to cover), and I‚Äôve identified $43M in outstanding net bearish premium (45% of free float exposed) still open, which I believe will act as gasoline on the fire if price begins to break out. Adding to the intrigue, the Skydance merger deal has created a forced price ceiling at $15, which institutions have been using to execute merger arbitrage trades‚Äîif that ceiling is broken, it could cause mass unwinding of short positions and a re-rating of the stock. Technicals are screaming reversal, with bullish divergence on multiple timeframes, the ADX setup mirroring historic breakout runs ($TSLA, $UPST, $DIS), and an imminent Golden Cross about to happen on the daily chart. If retail sentiment shifts and $PARA starts moving, this could be a perfect storm of undervaluation, squeeze potential, and institutional mispositioning, leading to a rapid and violent price correction to the upside. Everyone is sleeping on $PARA. It's time to wake up.

1ipmhfx,"Bridgewater is Betting on TSLA, Dumps GS and Buys More MRNA","Bridgewater Associates, the world‚Äôs largest hedge fund, made a notable shift in its investment strategy late last year, increasing its stake in electric vehicle (EV) giant Tesla while exiting positions in major companies like Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology.

According to Bridgewater‚Äôs latest 13-F filing, the firm purchased $62 million worth of Tesla shares, representing a 0.28% stake in the company during the fourth quarter of 2024. Tesla stock experienced a post-election rally following the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, largely due to CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs close relationship with the new administration. By the end of 2024, Tesla‚Äôs stock had surged 62%, but 2025 has proven more challenging, with shares already down 12%, amid concerns over slowing sales and Musk‚Äôs increasing involvement in other ventures.

Meanwhile, Bridgewater also expanded its position in Moderna, the vaccine manufacturer, acquiring 605,782 shares for a 0.12% stake. At the same time, it completely exited investments in Goldman Sachs and Micron Technology while drastically reducing its holdings in Applied Materials, a semiconductor company. The hedge fund further trimmed its exposure to consumer staples, cutting stakes in CVS Health and Tyson Foods, signaling a strategic shift in its portfolio.

I haven't really made a text post here before but I've seen the type of DD posted here and wanted to put in my own thoughts and get everyone's idea on Tesla's earnings today. I'm not here to suggest plays or talk about Elon's Tweets. Just the raw facts and what people think of the stock.

First off, Tesla is expected to report an adjusted profit of 77 cents per share, with sales at $27.2 billion. That's a step up from last year's 71 cents per share and $25.2 billion in sales. That's pretty good. In Q4 2024, Tesla cranked out approximately 459,000 vehicles and delivered over 495,000. While these are record numbers, they still fell short of the ambitious targets set by the Musk himself. That being said, these are all previous numbers and we need to try to predict today's numbers. With expectations so high, it might be difficult to beat earnings tonight.

We need to address the new administration obviously. They're going to be phasing out EV incentives so Tesla's projected sales might not be as high as we think. Elon has been touting a 20%-30% sales growth for 2025, but with reduced EV demand and competition from China... it might not be realistic.

Tesla might announce advancements in autonomous driving and upcoming product launches to keep the momentum going. A lower-priced EV, updated models, and the potential rollout of Full Self-Driving and robotaxi services are all in the pipeline. If Tesla can pull these off, it might just silence the haters and send the shorts running for cover. However, considering the last 10 years of ""improvements,"" it's highly unlikely.

Now consider what I've written above and the fact that the stock has dropped drastically 5 out of 7 previous earnings. What do you guys think?",2025-01-29 19:08:22,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1id1rk1/considering_tsla_earnings_today/

# Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE: KODK) ‚Äì Equity Research Report

# Rating: Overweight | Target Price: $18.50 | Current Price: $6.79

# Sector: Specialty Chemicals & Industrial Manufacturing

# Investment Summary

We initiate coverage on Eastman Kodak (NYSE: KODK) with an **Overweight** rating and a **target price of $18.50**, representing a **172% upside**. Kodak is undergoing a **structural transformation**, pivoting from a declining legacy print business into higher-margin verticals such as **pharmaceutical manufacturing and advanced materials**. Despite strong **underlying asset value**, significant **hidden real estate assets**, and a **near-term deleveraging catalyst**, the stock trades at **only 0.4x book value**, well below its intrinsic worth.

We believe **Wall Street misprices Kodak** by failing to incorporate:  
‚úÖ The **imminent launch of its pharma division in 2025**, with attractive margin dynamics.  
‚úÖ **Debt reduction from pension surplus**, improving FCF and balance sheet health.  
‚úÖ **Strong tariff tailwinds under the Trump administration**, positioning Kodak as a beneficiary of U.S. domestic manufacturing policies.  
‚úÖ **Underappreciated real estate assets (Eastman Business Park)**, with a potential fair value of **$175M-$200M**.

# 1. Company Overview & Strategic Pivot

Kodak operates across **four primary segments**:

1. **Print & Imaging (55% of 2024 revenue)**
   * Declining legacy business, but Kodak is stabilizing margins at **20% gross margin**.
2. **Advanced Materials & Chemicals (22%)**
   * High-margin segment (**27% EBITDA margin**) that supplies key specialty chemicals.
3. **Brand Licensing & Real Estate (10%)**
   * Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP), a 1,200-acre industrial park** undervalued on the balance sheet.
4. **Pharmaceuticals (13% by 2025)**
   * New revenue driver, projected to **generate $149M in 2025 with 35% margins**.

Kodak‚Äôs **pharmaceutical expansion** is the primary catalyst for **margin improvement and revenue diversification**. With **government incentives supporting domestic drug manufacturing**, Kodak is well-positioned for long-term growth.

# 2. Financial Model & Valuation

# 2.1 Revenue Breakdown & Forecast (2025-2029)

|**Division**|**2024 Revenue ($M)**|**2025 Revenue ($M)**|**2029 Revenue ($M) (Bull Case)**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Print & Imaging**|**$570M**|**$550M** (Decline)|**$510M**|

|**Net Debt ($M)**|**$460M**|**$145M**|**$50M**|
|**Net Debt / EBITDA**|**2.6x**|**0.7x**|**0.2x**|

üìå **Kodak is set to generate $120M in FCF in 2025**, a **50% improvement from 2024** due to lower CAPEX and debt reduction.

# 3. Key Catalysts & Upside Drivers

# 3.1 Pension Surplus & Debt Reduction

* Kodak **will use $315M in pension assets to reduce debt**, lowering interest costs by **$25M annually**.
* **Net debt will decline to $145M, reducing leverage to 0.7x EBITDA.**
* This **significantly increases Free Cash Flow (FCF) starting in 2025**.

# 3.2 Pharma Division Launch in 2025

* Kodak‚Äôs **API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) manufacturing facility** is near completion.
* The pharma sector offers **30%-40% gross margins**, significantly higher than print.
* **Government incentives for domestic API production could drive contract wins.**
* **Projected revenue: $149M in 2025 ‚Üí $250M by 2029.**

# 3.3 Trade Tariff Tailwinds

* **Trump‚Äôs trade policies favor U.S. manufacturers** in specialty chemicals and pharma.
* Tariffs on **Chinese imports** could make Kodak‚Äôs products **more competitive**.
* **Kodak is well-positioned as a U.S.-based supplier**.

# 3.4 Real Estate Monetization - Hidden Value in EBP

* **Eastman Business Park (EBP)** is worth **$175M-$200M**, but it‚Äôs booked at **$60M**.
* Leasing out or **selling portions of EBP could unlock value**.

# 4. Investment Risks & Mitigation

|**Risk Factor**|**Impact**|**Mitigation Strategy**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Declining Print Business**|Print revenue declining 5% YoY.|**high-margin Pharma & Chemicals**Focus on  .|
|**Execution Risk in Pharma**|Regulatory or contract issues.|**Target pre-signed API supply contracts**.|
|**Supply Chain & Tariff Risks**|Cost increases from import tariffs.|**Domestic manufacturing advantage** offsets risk.|

# 5. Conclusion: A Deep Value Play

Kodak presents a **compelling risk-reward opportunity** driven by:

1. **Pharma division launch in 2025** (high-margin growth engine).
2. **Debt reduction through pension surplus**, boosting FCF.
3. **Hidden real estate value in Eastman Business Park**.
4. **Trade tailwinds under Trump favoring domestic manufacturing**.

üìå **Rating: Overweight**  
üìå **Target Price: $18.50** (172% upside)

Kodak is a **highly asymmetric deep-value opportunity** with significant potential for re-rating in 2025. üöÄ



# ELI5: Why Kodak is a Good Investment Right Now üìà

Imagine you have **an old company like Kodak**, which used to make cameras and films. People think it‚Äôs outdated, but here‚Äôs the **secret**‚ÄîKodak is quietly transforming into something much bigger. And **Wall Street isn‚Äôt paying attention yet**.

Here‚Äôs why **smart investors** might want to take a closer look at Kodak:

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Kodak Is Getting Into Pharmaceuticals (Drugs üíä)

* Kodak is **building a factory** to make ingredients for medicines.
* This **new business starts in 2025** and will make **a lot more money per dollar spent** than selling old-school film and prints.
* Think of it like Kodak **switching from selling DVDs to streaming movies‚Äîit‚Äôs the future!**
* **This new drug business could bring in over $250M a year** in just a few years.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Kodak Is Paying Off a TON of Debt üí∞

* Kodak had **a special pension fund with $1.08 BILLION** saved up.
* They will use **$315M to pay down debt**, meaning they **don‚Äôt have to pay as much interest anymore**.
* **This frees up an extra $25M per year!**
* Less debt = **stronger company + more money to grow the business**.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hidden Gold Mine: Kodak Owns a HUGE Industrial Park üè≠

* Kodak owns **Eastman Business Park (EBP)**, a **1,200-acre** industrial site.
* Right now, it‚Äôs on the books for **only $60M**, but it‚Äôs actually worth **$175M+**.
* If they **sell or rent out more space**, Kodak could **make a lot of extra money**.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ The Government Might Help Kodak (Trump's Trade Policies üá∫üá∏)

* The U.S. **wants to make more stuff at home** (like medicine and tech parts).
* Kodak **makes things in America**, which means **they could get government support** and win new contracts.
* If new tariffs (taxes on foreign goods) happen, Kodak‚Äôs **U.S.-made products become more valuable**.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Kodak‚Äôs Stock Is TOO CHEAP üìâ

üìå **Right now, Kodak is trading at $6.79 per share.**  
üìå **Experts say it should be worth between $11.50 - $24.00 per share!**  
üìå That means the stock **could DOUBLE or even TRIPLE** in price.

# üí° What‚Äôs Next?

Kodak is **no longer just an ‚Äúold camera company.‚Äù** With **pharma, real estate, and smart debt moves**, it **could become a big winner** in the next couple of years.

‚úÖ **New drug business = more profits**  
‚úÖ **Less debt = more cash to grow**  
‚úÖ **Hidden assets = even more value**  
‚úÖ **Government policies = possible tailwinds**

**Right now, Wall Street isn‚Äôt paying attention‚Ä¶ but soon, they might.** üöÄ

1jozzx2,Musk‚Äôs Politics Don‚Äôt Define Tesla‚Äôs Value,"While I agree that Musk's actions in DC are reckless and inappropriate, we should not equate stock price to company value, now or when it was well over $400/share a few months ago. December's and today's prices represent emotions, not any rational evaluation. Similarly, short-term market reactions do not indicate long-term company value. Some other thoughts investors should keep in mind:

* TSLA is still the most significant upside/risk of any single stock I can find.
   * Tesla's long-term value to investors and the world has almost nothing to do with selling cars to consumers.
   * Despite that, Teslas are:
      * the safest and cleanest vehicles in the world, both in production and use
      * outstanding in comfort and performance
      * more affordable than other cars in their class, and many lower
      * have the highest margins of any mass producer
   * That results in the most profit and the greatest good of any comparable product. Yet, all that profit is just boot-strap funds for the arbitrarily greater good and profit to come in the next few years.
   * Tesla delivers all this while taking better care of their employees, especially factory workers, than the rest of the industry, including union shops.
* Tesla still stands out as the most moral and ethical major car maker, even accounting for Musk's recent politics.
   * You must look beyond the headlines and FUD stories of the last two decades to understand this, because the rest of them pay:
      * the advertising/protection money that keeps their evil acts out of the spotlight
      * the lobbyists/political money that keeps the governments off their backs
   * All that protection money also puts a negative spin on everything around Tesla because Tesla is their biggest threat.
   * When you do that research, especially if you include connections with fossil fuels, there is little left to subjectivity.
* Even beyond all his astounding technical and business accomplishments, Musk's greatest miracle is convincing the wing-nuts on the right to become interested in electric cars, and next, sustainability in general.
   * Tesla and Musk are mission-driven: accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
   * Placating wing-nuts on the left who claim to be on board already does nothing to accelerate, while convincing 1/4 of those who are politically resistant is a monumental effect.
   * Look at the search trends for ""buy Tesla"" if you need a visualization.
   * The middle of the herd always follows the rest.

Ultimately, Musk is not responsible for being allowed to do things the way he has always done. Only the President can force a change in that regard, and only Congress can legally force a change in the presidency. This level of access for DOGE and Musk is a symptom of a broken political duopoly and the forces perpetuating it from behind the scenes.

In any case, these emotions should not dictate our investment decisions. They should make us reevaluate as the world continues to change, but we should not react to the whims of the media lest we be controlled by those we should resist the most.

Displacing our resistance on Tesla is ineffective and is just the kind of distraction they want.",2025-04-01 16:31:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jozzx2/musks_politics_dont_define_teslas_value/
1joqcpy,Tesla down 64% YoY in Sweden (march),"Ai translated article below. I also included original article.


In March, 24,204 new passenger cars were registered in Sweden, according to new figures from the industry organization Mobility Sweden. This is an increase of 1.3 percent from the same month last year, but the market is still described as weak as new registrations are 23 percent below the month's average over the past five years.
In the first three months of the year, 63,444 cars have been registered in Sweden, which is an increase of 6 percent from last year.
Sales of Tesla cars have plummeted at the beginning of the year, and in March the decline accelerated. During the month, 911 cars of the brand were registered, which was a decrease of 64 percent from the same month last year. In the first three months of the year, Tesla registrations have decreased by 55 percent.
The decline has previously been explained by the fact that the best-seller Model Y is to come in an updated version, which has affected deliveries. Customers have also testified that they have distanced themselves from Tesla after the company's CEO Elon Musk became the American president Donald Trump's close ally.

1jln28t,Man arrested in Las Vegas Tesla arson facing federal charges,"A man arrested for allegedly setting Tesla vehicles on fire in Las Vegas earlier this month is now facing federal charges in the alleged Molotov cocktail attack.

The U.S. Justice Department said 36-year-old Paul Hyon Kim made an initial appearance Thursday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, where he is facing one count of unlawful possession of an unregistered firearm and one count of arson. He remains in federal custody.

Earlier this week, Kim was booked into the Clark County jail and initially charged with 15 counts by local authorities, including suspicion of arson, destroying personal property of another valuing $5,000 or more, possessing/disposing of a fire device and discharging a firearm into vehicle, according to jail records.

In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi called the recent string of arsons and vandalism targeting Teslas a ""wave of domestic terrorism,"" and said perpetrators will face severe consequences.

‚ÄúWe will continue to find, arrest, and prosecute these attackers until the lesson is learned,"" Bondi said in the statement.

1jk4fxn,FT row back it's claim about 1.4bn missing.,"  
[https://www.ft.com/content/d2711678-af23-4b71-852b-1ef2e932e14b](https://www.ft.com/content/d2711678-af23-4b71-852b-1ef2e932e14b)  
  
Mea culpa. Having last week got rather excited by the minutiae of Tesla‚Äôs accounting, its time to row back on the apparent $1.4bn gap between capital investment and asset values.

The question of why a cash-rich company raised new debt in both of the last two years still stands, as does the trajectory of that cash balance if car sales continue to crater. But Tesla‚Äôs balance-sheet mismatch may have a benign explanation.

Lessons below, including kind words from one of the expert correspondents who got in touch to say that ‚Äúreconciling accrual-based accounts with cash accounts (especially with the cash flow statement in its indirect form) is always difficult.‚Äù Indeed.

At issue was the difference between Tesla‚Äôs $6.3bn of capital investment in the second half of last year, and the smaller $4.9bn rise in the value of the gross assets it reported.

Two things help to reconcile the numbers: payments for assets already purchased, and the possible disposal of depreciated property.

The first is found at the bottom of the cash flow statement, where Tesla notes a balance sheet detail:

>

The line, explained in moderately simple terms [here](https://www.415group.com/blog/dealing-with-common-statement-of-cash-flows-issues), represents the balance of property plant and equipment purchased on credit. During the six months in question, Tesla paid down $689mn of those liabilities, shrinking the apparent gap to $733mn.

Asset disposals reduce the gap by another $270mn, to $463mn. While Tesla didn‚Äôt disclose any material asset sales or impairments, its capital investment figure is reported on a net basis. Comparing the depreciation expense with the change in accumulated depreciation indicates that assets depreciated by $270mn were disposed of.

The crack we‚Äôre left with at Tesla is now small enough ‚Äî just under half a billion dollars ‚Äî to be filled with some combination of foreign exchange movements, non-material asset write-offs, or the sale of machinery or equipment close to its not-fully depreciated value.

US investors may be interested to learn that under international accounting standards, no-such sleuthing is required because a reconciliation of these factors is published. For instance, here‚Äôs VW:

As we sound the Alphaville bugle while lowering this particular red flag, one unavoidable conclusion is that at a certain point it‚Äôs necessary to trust the auditor‚Äôs judgment.

Working capital movements are such an example. Last year, changes in ‚Äúaccounts payable, accrued and other liabilities‚Äù contributed $3.6bn to Tesla‚Äôs operating cash flow.

The line suggests that even though Tesla sales shrank last year, it improved its cash position in part by taking longer to pay suppliers.

Like other large listed companies, the link to the balance sheet figures is not immediately apparent. The total for ‚Äúaccounts payable‚Äù plus ‚Äúaccrued liabilities and other‚Äù fell by $300mn, to $23.5bn, which might suggest a small cash outflow overall. There was also a $2bn rise in long-term other liabilities, which are mainly composed of lease liabilities and warranty commitments.

The likely explanation, our new accountant friends tell us, is in the allocation of flows to the operations, investing or financing parts of the cash flow statement, which would require insider knowledge or documentation to reconcile.

If Tesla, which does not often respond to media requests, does come back with comments we‚Äôll update this post.

In the meantime, those fascinated by accounting minutiae still have plenty to hold their interest, as Tesla invests heavily in AI infrastructure and has almost $7bn worth of assets under construction. Cash generation and debt issuance remain areas of interest.

But with Tesla very nearly recovered to a fully diluted $1tn stock market valuation, what really matters to investors may present the bigger question.",2025-03-26 05:17:26,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jk4fxn/ft_row_back_its_claim_about_14bn_missing/

1jfmv7f,Call it what it is,"A family member recently purchased a model Y and she loves the car. However, now she is scared to drive it. She is older and watches the news so its peddled into her head that she may get shot or attacked by the mainstream liberals.

This is not just on reddit, multiple charging stations and dealerships are literally being shot up, blown up or firebombed. These are real actions people are taking and this isn't just reddit being reddit.

Don't make any mistake, this is 100% mainstream liberals/leftists, in:

The mainstream political class - See Tim Walz, VP candidate - rooting for the downfall of the 7th largest american company, no congress person on the left has disavowed this violence while others actively calling for it.
The mainstream leftist media, actively calls for violence and defends these people on a routine basis. MSNBC, CNN, AP, etc. All of them are culpable.
The mainstream leftist class - regular people keying cars, violent protests, acts of violence torwards tesla and tesla owners.
The online community - heavy supporters of violence and terrorism, chearing it on and inciting/calling for violence - doxing people, rewarding this behavior etc.
Their purpose is exactly what my family member is feeling - instilling terror on normal citizens to drive a piece of their own property around town. They want you to feel unsafe because you made a choice on what car to buy. This is their goal, make no mistake.

Fight back.

If you see someone perpertrating violence, video them, report them to the police and defend yourself and your property. I'm pleased to see that the admin is treating this as serious as they are. If you see a video of someone doing this, share it on social media, show it to your friends.

We must handle this as a community and fight back against legitamite terrorism. If you remain on the left, call your congress person and ask them to speak out against this.

Your grandma, daughter, mom, dad whoever, should not feel afraid in daily life because the left glorifies violence against citizens because they don't like Elon. It is abhorent behavior and I can't believe its gotten to this point.

The only way to deal with terrorism is to face it down and let the law do its job. Be careful, don't use violence, but make sure you are doing your part to ensure your family and friends feel safe. I wish this wasn't a mainstream leftist priority but it is.

Don't be scared, fight back and ensure this behavior is flipped on its head where people who think about instilling terrorism on normal people because of their car choice, get the full force of the law and they are the ones to be afraid.",2025-03-20 11:38:53,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jfmv7f/call_it_what_it_is/

1jedjdk,Why does no one talk about Tesla P/E?,"Long time Tesla bull (90% of my net worth and have been invested since 2015). But if you look at the trailing twelve month earnings per share or even the optimistic forward earnings per share in 2025, assuming no recession and car sales hold up (need to keep unemployment at this historical low that it is), Tesla PE will still be >100. This is extremely high for a top 10 company in the SP500. 

I think EPS for 2025 is reported to be between $2.55 and $3.30/share. If you even assume a 50x forward PE on that high end, that‚Äôs only $165/share and still trading at a premium. 

I truly believe Tesla will solve general autonomy for vehicles, and they‚Äôre clearly in the lead with an actual scalable approach, but I also believe at least some part of FSD is de facto valued in to the stock otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt trade at these multiples.. because revenue is not growing and profits are not growing. So what other justification is there? 

Long term I like the current valuation where it is, if you‚Äôre going to hold 5+ years. But you have to realize that FSD is somewhat baked in right?

1jeb4l9,"The same survey that showed 94% Germany won't buy Tesla, now shows 70% will buy Tesla","Tesla is NOT done in Germany‚Äìexact same poll debunks its own ‚Äú94% won‚Äôt buy Tesla‚Äù narrative

As of writing, 307,119 readers, or 69.9% of the study‚Äôs overall respondents, stated that they would still buy a Tesla.

As it turns out, news of Tesla‚Äôs demand death in Germany have been widely exaggerated. This is highlighted by the same poll that was used to frame the narrative that 94% of car buyers will not buy a Tesla in Germany.

So no, Tesla is not done in Germany. Nowhere close.

The Survey and the Reports
A look at the Tesla news cycle over the past few days would show that one of the biggest stories about the electric vehicle maker involved the results of a survey from German publication t-online. As per the reports, a survey of over 100,000 t-online readers has shown that 94% were not willing to buy a Tesla, and only a minuscule 3% were still willing to consider a vehicle from the American EV maker. 

t-online‚Äôs report on its survey, as well as articles that cited the study, related the alleged drop in Tesla interest in Germany to Elon Musk‚Äôs conservative politics. However, the survey itself received polarizing reactions among social media users since its respondents were self-selected. The poll also seemed open to everyone globally, so its results may not have been the most accurate.

These concerns, of course, were largely ignored and dismissed as the complaints of Tesla ‚Äúcult‚Äù members or ‚Äústans,‚Äù as critics stated on social media. Unfortunately for Elon Musk/Tesla critics, it appears that t-online‚Äòs Tesla poll is not done telling its story just yet.

Ongoing Survey, Drastically Different Results
While t-online published its article about Tesla‚Äôs alleged decline in Germany after the study passed 100,000 responses, the survey itself was actually left open. Thus, despite articles stating that Tesla is done in Germany already spreading online, t-online‚Äôs survey was still gathering data from respondents. Interestingly enough, the survey started showing a drastically different narrative once it started getting more respondents.

As of writing, a total of 439,111 respondents have participated in t-online‚Äôs Tesla survey. As of writing, 307,119 readers, or 69.9% of the study‚Äôs overall respondents, stated that they would still buy a Tesla. A total of 128,643 readers, or 29.3% of the study‚Äôs respondents, stated that they would ‚Äúabsolutely no way‚Äù consider a Tesla. A total of 3,296 t-online readers, or 0.8% of the survey‚Äôs current respondents, stated that they ‚Äúdo not know‚Äù if they would like to buy a Tesla.

Keeping Things in Perspective
While one could argue that the current findings of the survey are probably astroturfed by Tesla ‚Äústans‚Äù or ‚Äúcult‚Äù members, the fact remains that the poll itself was flawed to begin with. Its self-selected respondents could have been affected by bias, and the fact that it seemed open to all users across the globe suggests that the study may not have accurately represented Germany‚Äôs car buying public at all.

With this in mind, it would be unreasonable to argue that t-online‚Äòs poll was completely accurate up to its first 100,000 respondents but inaccurate when more respondents answered the survey. The reports that emerged from the first 100,000 respondents of the poll concluded that Tesla was finished in Germany. Following the same logic, one could argue that such reports were premature, and based on updated data from the same survey, Tesla still enjoys majority support in Germany.

1jdimnd,Why I decided to ‚Äúpanic first.‚Äù,"As the saying goes, there are two rules for long-term investing: 1) Don‚Äôt panic. 2) Panic first. 

I practiced rule number one for a long time. A little over a month ago, I finally decided to practice rule number two.

I was long for over 8 years. My cost basis was about $24 a share. I got completely out from Feb. 2-10. (One batch at $382.245/share and the second at $354.575/share.)

Obviously, my returns were fantastic, and I‚Äôm very happy with them. Tesla is now discounted over $115 from where I sold it, and I currently see no reason to jump back in.

I also owned 2 Teslas, one of which I recently sold, the other which will be sold soon. (They were both over 6 years old.) They were the 2 best cars I ever owned.

Unfortunately, Elon has proved a lot of the old-school Tesla haters right on a number of points and has brought what were before easily dismissed background, obscure quirks of an eccentric founder to the foreground of public opinion around the world. He has graduated from eccentric and quirky to erratic and unhinged. He is ignoring his responsibilities of the day-to-day operation of Tesla and actively working on supporting or even implementing government policy that will be or is already harmful to Tesla and its shareholders.

The stock is now not only untethered from reality (in a bullish way) by the arguably irrational exuberance of Elon‚Äôs bold vision, it‚Äôs now under mainstream attack for purely political reasons by huge swaths of the people who should be aligned with the company‚Äôs stated vision and should be buying what Tesla is selling and plans to sell in the future. The fundamentals do not support the valuation and have not for a very long time. The price is very much predicated on excellent execution of numerous key product roadmaps. Whether or not Tesla is able to effectively execute on delivering the AI, FSD/robotaxi, robotics, energy, and automotive roadmaps, there are very real concerns with their ability to overcome the brand damage Elon has caused and continues to cause. 

Whether or not you agree with the backlash, it is real and is proving to have material impact on sales and on the stock and on the brand value of the company.

I really used to believe in Elon. Unless and until I see the old genius Elon return to lead the company, or his influence is materially diminished to the point where he can no longer cause harm, I‚Äôm reluctant to reinvest. 

Whether it‚Äôs drugs, sleep deprivation, stress, psychiatric problems, or some other cause, unfortunately these sorts of wild slides of megalomania rarely end well. It is a sad public decline away from reality in the vein of those who were somehow damaged in their meteoric rise to the tops of their fields: Howard Hughes, Kanye West, Britney Spears, Mel Gibson, Michael Jackson, Sam Bankman-Fried, Harvey Weinstein.

I truly hope Elon finds a way to pull it together. Despite the haters, it‚Äôs undeniable that he is/was a generational outlier like Steve Jobs, Edison, Henry Ford, or any other of a small number of people who could rally resources and talent to deliver incredible, world-changing results.

Best of luck with your investment.",2025-03-17 17:38:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jdimnd/why_i_decided_to_panic_first/

1j8uu5k,Trump just advertised buying a Tesla,"If you had told me even just 1 year ago if I thought it were possible for Trump to advertise buying a Tesla, or literally any EV, I would've said you were crazy. But here we are.

Today Trump apparently posted on truth social saying that in order to stand with Elon against unjust attacks he would be buying a Tesla. I don't think people realize how massive this is.

Tesla's mission is to transition the world to renewable energy. Well, how do you do that if half the country stubbornly mostly does not want to even consider buying an EV? That, I think, is likely much less of a problem now than it was yesterday.

This isn't just bullish for Tesla, this is a huge win for environmentalism. We need conservatives to buy EVs, we can't just pretend that half the country doesn't exist when trying to solve this problem after all, and I stand by the fact that Elon really has been the only one seriously trying to market EVs to conservatives. And now all that effort has paid off.

I think every argument about Trump being bad for EVs and environmentalism is now turned on its head. If Trump is telling people ""I bought a tesla because it was the right thing to do"" then even though he supports increasing fossil fuel production he is helping popularize Tesla and in the longer term that means significantly more profits for Tesla, which means more grid battery production, which means grid-scale renewable energy becomes much more cost competitive with gas. And we all know that once solar panels and batteries get cheap enough they could easily replace coal and gas as our primary source of electricity in this country. Too many advantages to ignore (virtual powerplants, gridless homes, stable electricity networks, easily scalable power plants, low risk working environments, etc.).

Sure the economy is shitting the bed right now but once Trump is done with his trade war it will eventually return to normal. And at THAT time, that is when we will see the main benefits of what has just happened. The future is very bright!!!

1j455de,Elon & Tesla are getting short end of the stick with support for Trump/DOGE - What is the end game?,"Hey there, let‚Äôs chat about what‚Äôs been going on with Elon Musk lately, especially with his ties to Trump and that whole DOGE thing. Honestly, it‚Äôs not looking too great these days, and I‚Äôve been mulling it over. Tesla‚Äôs stock has taken a real beating‚Äîdown more than 35% from its peak, which is tough to stomach if you‚Äôre an investor or just a fan of the company. And it‚Äôs not just numbers on a screen; people are getting upset in the real world too. There‚Äôs been vandalism hitting Tesla cars and even the charging stations, which is crazy to think about. It feels like there‚Äôs this growing wave of frustration‚Äîor even outright anger‚Äîdirected at Tesla and the folks who drive them, not just here but all over the globe.

I can‚Äôt help but wonder where this is all headed. Some countries might start slapping extra tariffs on Tesla vehicles, maybe as a way to push back against Elon‚Äôs moves or just to make a point. It‚Äôs like the walls are closing in a bit, you know? And for what? I keep asking myself if Elon‚Äôs big gamble here is backfiring. Teaming up with Trump and jumping into this DOGE mess‚Äîdid he accidentally set himself up for a fall? Trump‚Äôs the kind of guy who might lean on Elon for as long as it suits him, then just walk away when he‚Äôs done, leaving Elon holding the bag. And that bag could be full of some pretty massive losses.

It‚Äôs hard not to think about the bigger picture too. If the political winds shift‚Äîsay, the next president‚Äôs a Democrat‚Äîthings could get even dicier for Elon. People are already tossing around wild ideas, like him facing legal trouble or, worst case, even prison. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll go that far, but it‚Äôs the kind of thing that keeps you up at night if you‚Äôre rooting for him. Right now, it‚Äôs tough to spot the silver lining. What‚Äôs the upside for Elon or Tesla in all this chaos? I‚Äôm scratching my head trying to figure it out, because from where I‚Äôm sitting, it looks like a rough road ahead with not much to show for it.

1j2zls5,Tesla electric car sales plunge again in Australia ‚Äì Model 3 down more than 81 per cent,"The retooling hypothesis doesn't hold up. 81% drop YoY for model 3.

Tesla's EV sales in Australia have plunged, with combined Model 3 and Model Y sales dropping 71.9% in February compared to last year. Model 3 sales fell over 81%, raising questions about demand beyond just inventory shortages.

Some analysts suggest that Elon Musk‚Äôs political alignment with far-right figures and Trump is affecting Tesla's brand, especially in Europe, where sales are also plummeting. Protests have occurred at U.S. Tesla dealerships, and a Canadian petition seeks to revoke Musk's citizenship.

Tesla stock has reversed post-election gains, and key executives‚Äîincluding board chair Robyn Denholm and Musk‚Äôs brother Kimbal‚Äîhave sold significant amounts of Tesla shares.

Meanwhile, competition from Chinese EV makers like BYD is increasing, and Polestar‚Äôs numbers show mixed results, with new models gaining traction. More industry-wide EV sales data is expected soon.

I think it's fair to discuss what options exist to reverse this trend? Outing Musk will likely help bring back EV demand but might also bring the stock back down to a reasonable valuation.

1j0wznr,"Tesla Sales Drop, Some Numbers and Considerations:","**TLDR**: The drop in Tesla‚Äôs sales is due to the retooling of the Model Y and the lack of inventory.

¬†

**Let‚Äôs Start with the Basics:**

The Tesla Model Y alone accounts for two-thirds, or about 67%, of all Tesla sales: 1.2 million out of 1.8 million annual production. The Model Y was, in 2023 and also in 2024, the world‚Äôs best-selling single model of car, . When considering revenue, the Model Y outperforms its competition by 50-70%. When considering profits (gross), the Model Y likely surpasses the rest of the top 10 combined, excluding the Ford F150 and the Model 3 (10th in the ranking with 500k sales). [source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/239229/most-sold-car-models-worldwide/#:~:text=The%20Tesla%20Model%20Y%20was,closely%20by%20the%20Toyota%20Corolla)

  
  


Tesla finished 2024 with no cars in inventory. Tesla's average has always been around 18 days of production, while the automotive industry average is 90 days, and 60 days is considered excellent (Toyota). Consider that this is actually the number of days from when the car leaves the factory until it reaches the customer ‚Äúready to drive,‚Äù so this number also includes transit times and the fact that the customer has to physically pick up the car. For a Model 3 produced in China to reach the customer in Europe, it takes about 30-40 days.

Tesla finished 2024 with 12 days of inventory, down from 19 days the previous quarter (highlighted in green), and sold 40k more Model 3/Y in the fourth quarter than it produced (highlighted in red). Considering that cars (still) don't drive themselves to the customer's garage, 12 days is likely the lowest possible inventory, and the lowest number of days in inventory since I started following this company in 2018.



https://preview.redd.it/a77bzmgu62me1.png?width=1954&format=png&auto=webp&s=23307eb89941520a0ee147fa7c1883dba542960b

(P.S. If you look at Q1 2024, the inventory is at a ‚Äúcatastrophic‚Äù  28 days. What happened last year in Q1 that extended the transit time of all the ships? The Red Sea crisis, which at the time was portrayed by the press as a disaster.)

To recap: Tesla ended 2024 with no inventory, and at the beginning of 2025 (second week of January), they started retooling the 4 factories that produce the Model Y, which alone accounts for 67% of sales. The retooling time is between 4 and 6 weeks, and we need to add 20 days, or about 3 weeks, for these cars to reach their customers. This means that in January, Tesla has essentially run out of Model Ys in almost the entire world. 

In February, Model Y sales will be practically zero because the factories are finishing retooling and the cars are in transit. We will see a recovery starting in March, with a full recovery expected in April/May.

Therefore, the various articles that talk about ‚ÄúTesla halved its sales because of Musk‚Äù are pushing a certain narrative. Even if it were true, Musk made the (awful) announcement on January 21, and it takes time for the news to spread‚Äîaround January 23-24. To say that in the remaining week of January, the last 20% of the month, Tesla‚Äôs sales were halved because of Musk is absurd. In fact, the fact that sales dropped ‚Äúonly‚Äù by 45% in the face of a 67% drop in production due to retooling shows that sales are still holding up.  
I can already predict that many articles this month will talk about the sales drop in February, which will be 60-70% lower than February of last year, when in reality the issue is that the cars haven‚Äôt arrived yet. The same applies to March, but the numbers might be down by 40%.



 Look at the numbers, not the emotions that the tabloids sell you.

In fact, when we talk about customer loyalty, which automotive brand dominates?

1iz57g8,Waymo is unprofitable,"When comparing Waymo and Tesla's autonomous driving approaches, several key disadvantages for Waymo emerge, primarily related to their operational model:
 * Geofencing Limitations:
   * Waymo's technology often relies on highly detailed, pre-mapped areas (geofencing). This means their autonomous vehicles primarily operate within these defined zones. This significantly limits their operational scope compared to Tesla, which aims for broader, unrestricted autonomy.
   * Expanding beyond these geofenced areas requires extensive mapping and testing, which is time-consuming and expensive.
 * Scaling and Infrastructure:
   * Waymo's business model, which involves deploying its own fleet of autonomous vehicles, requires significant capital investment in vehicles, maintenance, and infrastructure.
   * Scaling this model to a national or global level presents substantial logistical and financial challenges.
 * Data Collection:
   * Tesla's approach, which leverages data from millions of customer vehicles, provides a massive real-world dataset for training its AI. This gives Tesla a significant advantage in terms of data volume and diversity.
   * Waymo, while collecting very high quality data, does not have the volume of real world driving data that tesla has access to.
 * Consumer vehicle integration:
   * Tesla has the advantage of having its self driving software integrated into consumer owned vehicles. This allows for a much wider spread use of its technology, and allows for the gathering of much more real world driving data. Waymo is focused on Robotaxi and commercial applications, thus limiting their data collection, and consumer exposure.
In essence, Waymo's reliance on precise mapping and its fleet-based model creates limitations in scalability and operational flexibility compared to Tesla's data-driven, broader-application approach.


Waymo utilize tons of different sensors while Tesla only use cameras. 

It a no brainier that Tesla is going wipe out Waymo.

A current rumor on X that Elon said he will be ‚Äúworking 24/7 on DOGE to cut up to $2 TRILLION from the federal budget.‚Äù

I know some investors have been concerned about Elon‚Äôs focus on his companies. I felt this way after he first got bogged down with X. But then I saw that after he spent a few months through critical changes, he brought in a CEO to take over the day to day. 

And now that I think about it, I see potential long term benefits to the Tesla brand. If Elon ends up being right, surfaces a ton of government waste and his methods are validated resulting in saving the American taxpayer a ton of money, I think this will benefit the brand value among those on the right and in the middle. 

You can also imagine somewhere down the line that if he‚Äôs very successful with his cuts and findings, that Trump will give him some sort of major public recognition for what he‚Äôs done for the country. 

As an investor and someone who works in tech, I‚Äôve followed Elon closely for a long time. But now his name is becoming much more commonplace through the media.

1ihkwn7,A Record! 96% of new cars sold in Norway were EVs in January 2025,"Norwegians have set a new record for electric car registrations in January. Of the cars registered last month, 96% were electric cars, says the Norwegian Road Transport Council OFV.

Of January's 9,343 new passenger cars, 8,954 were electric. At the same time last year, the share of electric cars was 92 percent.

https://ofv.no/aktuelt/2025/god-2025-%C3%A5pning-for-nybilsalget

According to the press release, car sales have generally picked up in the fjords after the collapse of registered cars two years ago. 82 percent more cars were registered last month than in January 2024.

Norway's example shows that electric cars can become common quickly. If Tesla decides to shake things up and start innovating and designing new cars again, Tesla has a chance. 

However, Norway's TOP-10 electric car models sold in January show that Tesla has a lot of work to do if they want to keep up with the others

1igio37,Why a New CEO is Needed,"Musk is no longer focused on Tesla.

Since March 2020, the only new production model or ""product"" has been the Cybertruck.  Soon, that will be a total of five years.  We're two or three years into relatively slow growth.  Other manufacturers EVs without access to the Supercharger network have actually grown in the US in 2024.

Musk, seemingly, is putting little attention into Tesla and its mission, as seen by the Twitter acquisition, streaming gaming sessions, political fundraising and campaigning for/with Trump, [the ""DOGE"" effort with the White House](https://economictimes.com/news/international/global-trends/us-news-elon-musk-sleeping-at-doge-headquarters-donald-trump-gifts-him-lincoln-bedroom-at-the-white-house/articleshow/117781103.cms).

Assuming a few things...

1. Musk is good at keeping organizations focused on long term hard to reach goals

2. Musk is good at managing engineering teams

3. Taking Musk's own words as truth: management and engineers co-locating with production and ""in person"" at the office interactions are net positives.

4. Taking Musk's own words as truth: [employees not willing to do #3 should move on.](https://fortune.com/2024/01/30/remote-work-return-to-office-twitter-x-elon-musk-fires-employee-social-media-post/)

Musk is not doing #3 and thus is no longer performing #1 and #2 at Tesla for the mission.  Additionally, with his own logic, he is now in the group of employees that were let go (#4).

We need someone ready to put the time into executing on Robotaxis and Optimus.

A CEO that believes in Robotaxis and Optimus, at this point, is likely to be no worse than the current low attention Elon from an execution perspective, and from a brand perspective, a net positive.

1if2dtz,Help me understand people's different points of view about FSD,"French guy here. Tesla shareholder.

I really don't know what to think of FSD. On reddit, 50% of the people say v13 is mindblowing, the other half says it is still 5 years away from being unsupervised ready. On Youtube, the majority is positive. When I watch FSD videos the progress seems astounding, FSD's handling of some situations is truly incredible. But of course it needs to be close to perfect in an infinity of miles, not just for 1 hour.

What I don't understand is the discrepancies in people's opinions. Sadly I can't test FSD myself, being in Europe so I'm trying to understand. Some say geographical location is a factor, but I don't really see how that would be. I spent a year in Oklahoma and it's much easier to drive there than in California.

I've always believed that Tesla has the right approach. Humans don't have lidar. Objectively, what could be actual reasons for such a discrepancy in opinions? As a shareholder I must be as objective as possible, but having no way of testing FSD myself is frustrating.

EDIT: clarification on geographical location: What I meant is that people say FSD drives better in California (which seems more complex) than in other areas. Yes, it's been trained there most, but it doesn't make any sense for it to perform worse than in very easy areas such as Oklahoma.",2025-02-01 08:58:42,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1if2dtz/help_me_understand_peoples_different_points_of/

1id6dq9,How has this subreddit become an Elon Musk hate club? (+ FUD riddled bear case by random idiot),"EDIT: I wrote this expecting Q4 earnings to be on Friday, for some reason. The timing is accidental.  
  
I'm surprised to learn most people here don't seem to like Elon Musk all that much.

TSLA is near all time highs, most folks here seem to be worried about the upcoming call and given that they're in this subreddit in the first place, they're probably invested in Tesla. My question is, why? Why not cash out, now that the stock is so high?

I'll give you a quick, probably unoriginal bear thesis to get your money woof and justify the flair:

The bull case is based on AI-driving, and Tesla basically becoming the world's only major car maker. It is highly likely that neither of these things pan out the way investors hope, due to Elon Musk, who's made all those promises, clearly spiraling into madness.

Things that would be disastrous for Tesla (stock), which are all likely to happen this year: A falling out between Elon Musk and MAGA world, a trade war with China, a boycott in Europe and US coastal states over the 'accidental' Nazi salute, which he never claimed was accidental; Elon doing something even more erratic, Tesla switching to lidar to overcome physical limitations of using only cameras, thus invalidating the entire robo-cab vision; Cybertruck turning out to be a flop, legacy car makers actually having time to get their sh\*t together because Musk refuses to develop a sub $25k hatchback.

Once one of these cards fall, the entire house crashes down (at least, to a reasonable valuation, because Tesla is still a good company, just way overvalued).

This is coming from a former Elon fanboy, and someone who believed that Tesla would actually be worth its current valuation one day, and be producing about 10 times as many cars as it does currently. There are now serious threats to that potential, and they're all caused by the man who created it in the first place.

Tesla should've introduced a sub 25k car last year, instead they don't even have one in the works. It should've used Lidar in its self-driving technology, instead it only uses cameras which, any photographer will tell you, have physical limitations.  It shouldn't have misled people about the robot, its CEO shouldn't have done the Nazi salute and alienate literally every European country and US coastal state.

Why does the Cybertruck even exist? Why was that robo-taxi even introduced? When Tesla proposed the Roadster and those Semis, the company actually made sense. Now it just does random weird stuff, weird stuff that doesn't appear to be successful at all.

And yet, the company is valued as if we're in an alternate universe where Tesla did build the Semi, did build the Roadster, and most importantly, did build the Model 2, which would've been a $25-ish Golf-like car with a steering wheel.",2025-01-29 22:19:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1id6dq9/how_has_this_subreddit_become_an_elon_musk_hate/

# Here's a brief synopsis of the video:

* **Introduction and Setup**:
   * The challenge involves testing BYD‚Äôs autonomous driving capabilities under extreme conditions in a crowded, rural Chinese city at night, with a mix of people and scooters on the roads.
   * The test vehicle is the Denza G9 GT, capable of urban autonomous driving but not yet fully updated for parking features.
* **Initial Observations**:
   * The car adjusts smoothly to dynamic situations like people walking onto the road, scooters changing lanes unexpectedly, and non-standard traffic patterns.
   * It handles missing lane markings and unusual left-turn signals well, demonstrating reliable lane-changing and speed adjustments.
* **Complex Traffic Scenarios**:
   * Encounters included scooters suddenly appearing, pedestrians jaywalking, and erratically parked vehicles.
   * The AI adjusts speed, yields to pedestrians, and navigates intersections effectively, though it struggles with areas lacking traffic signals or clear road markings.
* **Challenges with Local Traffic Norms**:
   * In some areas, straight and left-turn signals work simultaneously, leading to chaos.
   * The car successfully handles these situations, adhering to traffic rules while ensuring safety for nearby scooters and pedestrians.
* **Specific Difficulties**:
   * In a school zone, the car yielded to crossing students, causing a delay that led to a violation notification for obstructing traffic.
   * This highlighted differences in local driving expectations and challenges faced by autonomous systems in adhering to nuanced human behaviors.
* **Performance in Crowded Areas**:
   * The car safely navigated through congested areas like shopping districts with heavy foot and scooter traffic.
   * Despite tight spaces and unpredictable movements, the AI avoided collisions and maintained a smooth ride.
* **Critiques and Reflections**:
   * Observations on China‚Äôs traffic system pointed out inefficiencies like conflicting signals and reckless driving behaviors.
   * The narrator expressed frustration over receiving a traffic violation for prioritizing pedestrian safety.
* **Conclusion**:
   * The test showcased the potential and limitations of the BYD vehicle‚Äôs autonomous driving in extreme real-world conditions.
   * The system‚Äôs reliance on LIDAR and its ability to handle chaotic traffic were impressive, but legal and cultural challenges remain significant barriers.
   * Questions were raised about whether similar autonomous features would be released in other markets like Korea.",2025-01-28 07:35:26,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1ibwef1/if_byd_has_fsd_v13_already_in_china_whats_teslas/

1ia9zgd,"Tesla‚Äôs Future: Beyond Cars ‚Äì AI, FSD, Robots & the Mission that Matters","Hey everyone

Let's take a moment to refocus on what Tesla's all about. 

Their mission? ""To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.""

Given the controversy over the last weeks, it's hard to remember the good things. And let's not forget, people don't hold grudges forever.

Beyond just making cool electric cars, Tesla has some game-changing tech:

**- Full Self-Driving (FSD):** They're pushing the envelope with FSD, aiming for fully autonomous rides. The Cybercab could be huge, given that more and more countries will allow FSD.

**- Robotics:** Remember Optimus. Tesla's humanoid robot designed to handle everyday tasks. 

**- Cheap Tesla Model:** Likely to come, given the Chinese and European competition. 

**- Artificial Intelligence:** Tesla's leveraging AI not just for cars but across various platforms.

**-** **Economies of scale**: subsidies-cuts hurt other automakers more, as it will be more difficult to enter the market, and many other brands are more expensive than Tesla.

Analysts are optimistic. Some see ""new age opportunities"" (https://www.investopedia.com/these-analysts-see-new-age-opportunities-pushing-tesla-stock-toward-usd500-8778088). There's huge potential in their AI and robotics ventures. Price targets range from $500-550 and more than that.

Let's keep the bigger picture in mind. Tesla's not just about cars... it's about leading a sustainable and technologically advanced future, one that most countries in the world want.

The stock has had plenty of ups and downs over time such as the 420 moment, Giga Factory ramp ups, and recent layoffs. Currently my shares have gained around 1800% on the initial investment. This has me wondering is now the time to sell? The current market cap on Tesla is $1.3 trillion USD. I guess my thought process is how much more can Tesla honestly gain over next 12-24 months? Previously we had big product roll outs such as Gigafactories openings, super charger expansion, and new vehicles. The 2024 deliveries where down 1% over previous year. I can see deliveries increasing in the future but I don't see previous growth such as Model Y roll out happening soon. That means Tesla will need to either massively cut costs to raise margins or need a big breakthrough such as full level 5 self driving AI. Tesla's current annual revenue is around $100 billion USD. Google with a market cap of 2.45 trillion has annual revenue of $278 billion USD. Even if Musk's current closeness to Trump administration is helpful I dob't see a way to get revenue anyone near that level and increasing the market cap.

1i6gn1t,"For the good of Tesla, the company, Musk the CEO has to go.","Musk is the CEO and public face of Tesla. Back in it early days (pre-2018) he was awkward but enthusiastic, progressive and apolitical. You would buy a Tesla-made car because it was different, fun, fast, smart and relatively green. The company as led by Musk kick-started the electric car as a viable option and revolutionised the car industry.

Now, Musk has gone down a very murky rabbit hole. His public face is less about his companies, and more about his politics. He has huge influence, and not in a way the most of the world wants.

A European study has shown that 30% of Tesla owners in the Netherlands are considering selling their car or have already done so. Tesla sales in Q4 2024 are down 40% compared to the previous year. Global sales are down 1.1%, the first ever drop in sales since 2011.

Anecdotally, in Australia, everyone I have talked to has said they would not consider buying a Tesla now. Tesla sales in Australia for 2024 are down 1.5% for the model 3 and 26% for the model Y.

There are many reasons why this decline could be occurring. Interest rates are still up. The Model Y refresh is pending. But I think a huge part is the disenchantment of buyers because of Musk's public face.

  
I think Musk should go. Musk is damaging Tesla. He should not be CEO. I think as shareholders we should protect our interests and vote for him to be removed as CEO.

1hw2ga5,"We need to talk about China, again: L2+ / L3 ADAS in 2025","# Grab a tea, it's gonna be a long one.

Many regulars here know I‚Äôve been tracking China‚Äôs EV/AV industry for a while, paying it special attention, and posting annual updates [with my findings](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/18xvahw/revisiting_china_a_look_to_the_middle_kingdom_as/).

When I wrote my first post ‚Äî [""You need to know what's going on in China""](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/xvlbeq/you_need_to_know_whats_going_on_in_china/) ‚Äî¬†it was because I thought most people here hadn‚Äôt clued into the underreported and rapidly changing dynamic in the Chinese EV market. At the time, China was mostly fielding oddballs like the Nio ES8 and Wuling Mini, but the release calendar was all of a sudden (and very quietly) filling up with world-beater vehicles like Li‚Äôs L9 and Xpeng‚Äôs G9. These cars had attractive exterior styling, interiors to match, powerful electric drivetrains, and were packed with technology foreign automakers had roadmapped for five or six years in the future. More astoundingly, dozens of them were being announced all at once, many of them from unexpected players like electronics brands Xiaomi and Huawei.¬†

[Huawei's AVATR 11 is a stunner.](https://preview.redd.it/qoqifoi2umbe1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a412f7d3537b9248f63db72e1c7e7062188d2f5c)

Honda COO Shinji Aoyama [after visiting the Shanghai Auto Show](https://archive.ph/iOnBQ) that year, put it bluntly: ""We were overwhelmed by the Chinese.""

Things have changed significantly since then. China is now [the world's largest exporter of cars](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65643064), and the world‚Äôs [largest producer of EVs by far](https://uk.motor1.com/news/741912/half-of-all-evs-made-in-china/). The US and EU have very publicly gone on warpath, slapping 100% and 40% respective tariffs on Chinese-origin cars. Volkswagen is [now an investor in Xpeng](https://ir.xiaopeng.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xpeng-and-volkswagen-group-announce-entry-framework-agreement), and has announced all future Volkswagen cars made in China [will now be on Xpeng‚Äôs platform](https://technode.com/2024/07/23/xpeng-to-contribute-to-all-volkswagen-evs-in-china-starting-2026/). Ford now imports Chinese cars to take them apart in Detroit, and CEO Jim Farley [is obsessed with his Xiaomi SU7](https://www.motor1.com/news/738491/ford-ceo-jim-farley-praises-xiaomi/).

I finally [personally visited](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ef2k6r/views_from_pingan_guangxi/) China last year. It was incredible, and I think the rate of progress there would shake a lot of people to the core. Guangzhou is quiet, clean, and electric. Aion and BYD EVs silently glide down the streets, while Huawei showcases fill shopping malls. China, somehow, did what the west wasn‚Äôt able to do. It made EVs happen.¬†

Well, it's time to do it all over again.¬†

# A Growing Expertise in General AI

One foundational phenomenon to understand here is the growing trend of Chinese supremacy in AI and growing availability of Chinese AI talent. AI was born in North America, but it is now blooming in China. A [recent Paulson Institute study](https://macropolo.org/interactive/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/) tracking global AI talent found that China produces nearly as many AI graduates as the rest of the world combined ‚Äî 47% of the world‚Äôs entire supply, with the US next in line at 18%. In fact, researchers originally from China now make up 38% of the top researchers working in the United States, with Americans only making up 37%. At the latest NeurIPS (2024), [listed affiliations with Tsinghua and Peking universities](https://papercopilot.com/paper-list/neurips-paper-list/neurips-2024-paper-list/) greatly outnumbered those from Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.¬†

[China produces 47&#37; of the world's top AI talent.](https://preview.redd.it/qeoelhodumbe1.png?width=2154&format=png&auto=webp&s=337ee5dc18db9186012268667edad231d3815a7d)

Over at r/LocalLLAMA, [the hot button topic is DeepSeek V3](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1hofvtw/deepseek_v3_is_absolutely_astonishing/), a Chinese-developed language model which performs comparatively to Google and OpenAI‚Äôs latest models but was [trained at a fraction of the cost](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1872362712958906460) by a much smaller team. You can [try it here](https://chat.deepseek.com/), it‚Äôs astounding work. Qwen, another model series developed at Alibaba, is generating similar buzz. Kling AI ‚Äî a video generator similar to OpenAI‚Äôs Sora ‚Äî¬†[not only beat Sora to market](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/technology/china-open-source-ai.html), but is widely considered to [produce better results](https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1867716787250598019).¬†

The pattern we‚Äôre seeing here is clear ‚Äî¬†and it‚Äôs happening in automotive too.

# A Flurry of Full-scenario Deployments Backed by Fast Hardware Adoption

While full-scenario ‚ÄòL2+‚Äô city-driving deployments have largely been slow in NA and the EU, in China they have been so fast and furious it‚Äôs almost hard to keep up. At least a half-dozen brands have already launched bleeding-edge nationwide systems, and more are on the way. Huawei‚Äôs HIMA initiative ([mentioned last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/18xvahw/revisiting_china_a_look_to_the_middle_kingdom_as/))¬†has released a full-scenario AI system to *nearly a dozen models in total*, including its own entire Aito lineup.

Xpeng and Nio have been two of the earliest and steadiest, bringing their systems to all roads in China last year via OTA, but take note of one even stronger showing: Li Auto may be the first OEM in the world to deploy an E2E + VLM AI to production. Li‚Äôs system not only shows you the possible trajectories it has calculated, but [diagrams and explains the decisions it is making](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTODFZvg5qI) as it does.¬†

[Li Auto's VLM Driver Display](https://preview.redd.it/lba0ajckumbe1.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=a05974f508f5fb9ba34b9d6aa43226ca177589d1)

Nio, Xpeng, and Li have all had their rapid deployments aided by the early adoption of NVIDIA‚Äôs Orin X chip, but nearly a half-dozen other manufacturers have also delivered vehicles using Orin and the list is growing. Xiaomi‚Äôs SU7 uses dual Orins, as does Zeekr‚Äôs 007 and 7X. Yangwang‚Äôs U8 and U9 use Orin setups too, as do IM‚Äôs LS8 and LS7.

This fast-adoption pattern is not stopping or slowing down: Geely Zeekr and Li Auto both announced they‚Äôll be [among the first to adopt](https://cnevpost.com/2024/01/09/li-auto-to-use-nvidia-drive-thor-next-gen-evs/) NVIDIA‚Äôs new Thor platform when it launches this year, and the Geely Lynk 900 [has already been confirmed](https://carnewschina.com/2025/01/03/lynk-co-900-unveiled-as-a-phev-with-up-to-630-kw-of-power/) to get it. When it launches, it will do so with a road-proven E2E architecture on day one.

# The Flywheel

As Chinese OEMs make progress on software, so are they making progress on the hardware powering it. Geely‚Äôs ECARX and SiEngine subsidiaries are already producing entirely in-house SoC and ECU‚Äôs powering their Lynk lineup. This year, [SiEngine will introduce Starlight AD1000](https://carnewschina.com/2024/10/26/siengines-starlight-7nm-autonomous-driving-chip-successfully-lit-up/), their next-generation compute package aimed at >500 TOPS, the same compute class as 2x Orin packages.

Nio and Xpeng are also both moving to similar in-house chips. Nio‚Äôs [Shenji NX9031](https://www.notebookcheck.net/5nm-NIO-Shenji-autonomous-driving-chip-debuts-with-the-power-of-4x-Nvidia-Drive-Orin-processors.787259.0.html) will debut on the new flagship ET9 early this year. Xpeng has already replaced NVIDIA‚Äôs Orin with their own in-house ‚ÄòTuring‚Äô chip on the P7+, and says that soon it will introduce an ‚ÄòUltra‚Äô high-spec 3000 TOPS configuration of a Turing-based system capable of allowing L4 operation. These companies intend to mass-manufacture their chips and deploy them across their entire lineups.

[Nio's Shenji NX9031](https://preview.redd.it/0esdnhu7wmbe1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c31594cddcc42433bbd19e69ccfc15569ef95b42)

Suppliers, meanwhile, are stepping up to meet demand: Horizon, a partner to Volkswagen, Li, BYD, and Chery, is [launching Journey 6](https://www.smartautoclub.com/en/p/75101/), a lineup of ADAS chips aimed at L2+, while Xiaomi-backed Black Sesame will introduce [Huashan A2000](https://autonews.gasgoo.com/icv/70035562.html) this year and Huixi Technology begins to offer the same-class [Guangzhi R1](https://autonews.gasgoo.com/icv/70034902.html).¬†

DJI ‚Äî¬†yes, that DJI ‚Äî¬†has also entered the fray. The world-famous drone maker aims to be a major multiple-brand supplier, and has already prepared a full lineup of offerings for OEMs to choose from. Its [Zhuoyu Chenxing](https://www.zyt.com/en) Intelligent Driving division makes not only the software but the chips and vision systems for Baojun‚Äôs Yunhai, a $15K USD compact crossover with full-scenario L2.

[*That‚Äôs where the bar is now.*¬†](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka3wxVQYqvQ)

# What to Watch This Year

It‚Äôs important to underscore how quickly this transition has taken place. A year ago, there were no Chinese top-ten OEMs with a full-scenario L2 ADAS offering. Now every single OEM in the top ten has one, and in many cases it‚Äôs a standard feature.

As OEMs push the boundaries of scale, component cost is coming down dramatically, and systems are maturing. Lidar-maker Hesai, which supplies Xiaomi and Li Auto, plans to [roll out a $200 LIDAR this year](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-hesai-halve-lidar-prices-next-year-sees-wide-adoption-electric-cars-2024-11-27/), the ATX. Both Hesai and their rival Robosense also plan to release behind-the-windshield units this year, solving the ‚Äòbump‚Äô problem.

[Robosense‚Äôs MX Lidar can be placed behind the windshield. No more bump.](https://preview.redd.it/q7oy3xuewmbe1.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dd49b3460cbbaa1764fed8fe1946848880bf562)

Momenta is a big one to pay attention to. The company‚Äôs ‚ÄúMomenta Pilot‚Äù E2E solution is already deployed on SAIC‚Äôs IM series, and has big wins from international automakers. Mercedes and Toyota were early investors in Momenta, and both plan to roll out Momenta-based ADAS offerings this year ‚Äî Mercedes with the CLA and Toyota with the bZ3X. Also an investor in Momenta: GM, which along with partner SAIC, is already testing Momenta-based L4 Cadillac Lyriq robotaxis in the Shanghai area.¬†

Finally, as always, the sleeping monster ‚Äî¬†BYD. The company has been playing relatively cool with ADAS, but has recently ramped things up to incredible scale, unveiling its Xuanji Architecture and [a $14B R&D purse](https://cnevpost.com/2024/01/17/byd-unveils-vehicle-intelligence-strategy/). It plans to deploy an in-house E2E architecture as soon as this year.

# Lessons

What we witnessed with Chinese EVs wasn't just a story about building electric cars; it was a story of the holistic development of an entire ecosystem. It was about mobilizing industry, pushing constituent technologies, and refining supply chains. It was a dyno spinning up. What we‚Äôre seeing in China now with ADAS mirrors that previous development.

While western commentators talk about moats and trillion-dollar valuations, that discussion has effectively disappeared in China. Buoyed by an incredible supply of AI talent, a supervised full-scenario system is table-stakes ‚Äî it‚Äôs all grind now. Components, chips, and software are all near-commodities. There will be no single dominant player.¬†It‚Äôs becoming quite likely that by the end of the year, L2+ ADAS will be a standard feature on all new Chinese vehicles over $20k, with the next wave being the rapid development of high-level L3 and L4 automations.¬†

For those of you thinking about what the future (and future challenge for Tesla) looks like, this is a good time to take a look at China. Bleeding-edge architectural features like VLMs seeing deployment show the way forward, automakers are reaching towards 1000TOPS and beyond, and sensor packages are maturing quickly. It‚Äôs gonna be a trip.",2025-01-07 21:24:07,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1hw2ga5/we_need_to_talk_about_china_again_l2_l3_adas_in/
1hw0zyp,Tesla's autonomous driving advantage?,"The bull thesis on why Tesla is leading the pack is they have the largest fleet of cars (\~7M) capturing real world data that can be used by their supercomputer to train the neural network for autonomous driving. No other competitor has the raw data or the training compute at the moment. There's also the idea that it's a winner take most achievement - nobody will buy non-AI cars when they've been proven to be better so Tesla will just run away with the market. How can competitors catch up if they don't have the vehicle fleet to go out there and collect data, train AI and solve FSD behind Tesla etc.

I just watched Jensen Huang's CES presentation and one thing that raised a flag for me was how he explained synthetic AI generated video could be created to train AI. In other words, you can have 0 vehicles on the road, nothing collecting real world data, but you have Nvidia's chips to synthetically create AI video out of nothing, and still end up being able to solve FSD. ie. You can ask your AI model to simulate a billion different videos of cars going through roundabouts, unprotected lefts, pedestrians running on the street, construction site detours etc. (all the edge cases that make solving that last 1% so hard). Tesla is likely the first to get there, but catching up may not be as difficult a task as we are predicting it to be - as long as you have enough money to throw at the problem, it becomes a ""funding"" and ""timing"" problem as opposed to being dependent on consumers buying enough of your cars to be on roads to collect data to train.

1hq4ijo,Tested Tesla FSD V13 in Heavy Snow Yesterday,"Yesterday, I tested Tesla‚Äôs FSD V13 in a snowy environment. The outbound trip lasted about 10 minutes, and everything worked smoothly with no major issues.

However, on the way back, the snow intensified, and the wind picked up significantly. This caused the front cameras to struggle with visibility, making it hard for the system to detect the road properly. As a result, the car notified me that FSD was unavailable and required human intervention.

This experience highlights a key limitation of Tesla‚Äôs vision-based system‚Äîextreme weather can significantly impact its effectiveness.

It‚Äôs clear that human intelligence is still far superior when it comes to recognizing and handling complex, unpredictable situations. FSD has made impressive strides, but it still has a long road ahead.

* ""GM to stop funding Cruise due to competitive market
* CEO Barra emphasizes focus on future technology
* Cruise agreed to pay $500,000 fine for false report in crash investigation""

The automaker has poured over $10 billion into Cruise since 2016, but the unit will now be integrated into its team developing driver assistance technology.

This shift follows GM's decision to scale back its electric vehicle ambitions, divest its share in a joint venture battery plant, and restructure its operations in China, refocusing on its core strength: producing profitable gasoline-powered pickup trucks and other large vehicles.

Tesla plans to launch robotaxi service in California and Texas next year, Deutsche Bank said. Tesla had set that goal earlier this year.

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a department for government efficiency,‚Äù Musk said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to help make it happen.‚Äù On Tuesday, Trump appointed Musk and another ally to head such an entity, which is not an official government agency, leaving its function still undefined.

Musk‚Äôs influence is expected to go beyond efficiency initiatives. The billionaire, who contributed at least $119 million to a pro-Trump campaign group, is anticipated to play a role in shaping the president-elect‚Äôs choice for the next Transportation Department secretary, according to a source familiar with Musk‚Äôs and Trump‚Äôs transition plans. This department, which oversees the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), could implement major changes to national self-driving vehicle regulations.

1jozzx2,Musk‚Äôs Politics Don‚Äôt Define Tesla‚Äôs Value,"While I agree that Musk's actions in DC are reckless and inappropriate, we should not equate stock price to company value, now or when it was well over $400/share a few months ago. December's and today's prices represent emotions, not any rational evaluation. Similarly, short-term market reactions do not indicate long-term company value. Some other thoughts investors should keep in mind:

* TSLA is still the most significant upside/risk of any single stock I can find.
   * Tesla's long-term value to investors and the world has almost nothing to do with selling cars to consumers.
   * Despite that, Teslas are:
      * the safest and cleanest vehicles in the world, both in production and use
      * outstanding in comfort and performance
      * more affordable than other cars in their class, and many lower
      * have the highest margins of any mass producer
   * That results in the most profit and the greatest good of any comparable product. Yet, all that profit is just boot-strap funds for the arbitrarily greater good and profit to come in the next few years.
   * Tesla delivers all this while taking better care of their employees, especially factory workers, than the rest of the industry, including union shops.
* Tesla still stands out as the most moral and ethical major car maker, even accounting for Musk's recent politics.
   * You must look beyond the headlines and FUD stories of the last two decades to understand this, because the rest of them pay:
      * the advertising/protection money that keeps their evil acts out of the spotlight
      * the lobbyists/political money that keeps the governments off their backs
   * All that protection money also puts a negative spin on everything around Tesla because Tesla is their biggest threat.
   * When you do that research, especially if you include connections with fossil fuels, there is little left to subjectivity.
* Even beyond all his astounding technical and business accomplishments, Musk's greatest miracle is convincing the wing-nuts on the right to become interested in electric cars, and next, sustainability in general.
   * Tesla and Musk are mission-driven: accelerate the transition to sustainable energy.
   * Placating wing-nuts on the left who claim to be on board already does nothing to accelerate, while convincing 1/4 of those who are politically resistant is a monumental effect.
   * Look at the search trends for ""buy Tesla"" if you need a visualization.
   * The middle of the herd always follows the rest.

Ultimately, Musk is not responsible for being allowed to do things the way he has always done. Only the President can force a change in that regard, and only Congress can legally force a change in the presidency. This level of access for DOGE and Musk is a symptom of a broken political duopoly and the forces perpetuating it from behind the scenes.

In any case, these emotions should not dictate our investment decisions. They should make us reevaluate as the world continues to change, but we should not react to the whims of the media lest we be controlled by those we should resist the most.

Displacing our resistance on Tesla is ineffective and is just the kind of distraction they want.",2025-04-01 16:31:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1jozzx2/musks_politics_dont_define_teslas_value/

1id6dq9,How has this subreddit become an Elon Musk hate club? (+ FUD riddled bear case by random idiot),"EDIT: I wrote this expecting Q4 earnings to be on Friday, for some reason. The timing is accidental.  
  
I'm surprised to learn most people here don't seem to like Elon Musk all that much.

TSLA is near all time highs, most folks here seem to be worried about the upcoming call and given that they're in this subreddit in the first place, they're probably invested in Tesla. My question is, why? Why not cash out, now that the stock is so high?

I'll give you a quick, probably unoriginal bear thesis to get your money woof and justify the flair:

The bull case is based on AI-driving, and Tesla basically becoming the world's only major car maker. It is highly likely that neither of these things pan out the way investors hope, due to Elon Musk, who's made all those promises, clearly spiraling into madness.

Things that would be disastrous for Tesla (stock), which are all likely to happen this year: A falling out between Elon Musk and MAGA world, a trade war with China, a boycott in Europe and US coastal states over the 'accidental' Nazi salute, which he never claimed was accidental; Elon doing something even more erratic, Tesla switching to lidar to overcome physical limitations of using only cameras, thus invalidating the entire robo-cab vision; Cybertruck turning out to be a flop, legacy car makers actually having time to get their sh\*t together because Musk refuses to develop a sub $25k hatchback.

Once one of these cards fall, the entire house crashes down (at least, to a reasonable valuation, because Tesla is still a good company, just way overvalued).

This is coming from a former Elon fanboy, and someone who believed that Tesla would actually be worth its current valuation one day, and be producing about 10 times as many cars as it does currently. There are now serious threats to that potential, and they're all caused by the man who created it in the first place.

Tesla should've introduced a sub 25k car last year, instead they don't even have one in the works. It should've used Lidar in its self-driving technology, instead it only uses cameras which, any photographer will tell you, have physical limitations.  It shouldn't have misled people about the robot, its CEO shouldn't have done the Nazi salute and alienate literally every European country and US coastal state.

Why does the Cybertruck even exist? Why was that robo-taxi even introduced? When Tesla proposed the Roadster and those Semis, the company actually made sense. Now it just does random weird stuff, weird stuff that doesn't appear to be successful at all.

And yet, the company is valued as if we're in an alternate universe where Tesla did build the Semi, did build the Roadster, and most importantly, did build the Model 2, which would've been a $25-ish Golf-like car with a steering wheel.",2025-01-29 22:19:54,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1id6dq9/how_has_this_subreddit_become_an_elon_musk_hate/

# Here's a brief synopsis of the video:

* **Introduction and Setup**:
   * The challenge involves testing BYD‚Äôs autonomous driving capabilities under extreme conditions in a crowded, rural Chinese city at night, with a mix of people and scooters on the roads.
   * The test vehicle is the Denza G9 GT, capable of urban autonomous driving but not yet fully updated for parking features.
* **Initial Observations**:
   * The car adjusts smoothly to dynamic situations like people walking onto the road, scooters changing lanes unexpectedly, and non-standard traffic patterns.
   * It handles missing lane markings and unusual left-turn signals well, demonstrating reliable lane-changing and speed adjustments.
* **Complex Traffic Scenarios**:
   * Encounters included scooters suddenly appearing, pedestrians jaywalking, and erratically parked vehicles.
   * The AI adjusts speed, yields to pedestrians, and navigates intersections effectively, though it struggles with areas lacking traffic signals or clear road markings.
* **Challenges with Local Traffic Norms**:
   * In some areas, straight and left-turn signals work simultaneously, leading to chaos.
   * The car successfully handles these situations, adhering to traffic rules while ensuring safety for nearby scooters and pedestrians.
* **Specific Difficulties**:
   * In a school zone, the car yielded to crossing students, causing a delay that led to a violation notification for obstructing traffic.
   * This highlighted differences in local driving expectations and challenges faced by autonomous systems in adhering to nuanced human behaviors.
* **Performance in Crowded Areas**:
   * The car safely navigated through congested areas like shopping districts with heavy foot and scooter traffic.
   * Despite tight spaces and unpredictable movements, the AI avoided collisions and maintained a smooth ride.
* **Critiques and Reflections**:
   * Observations on China‚Äôs traffic system pointed out inefficiencies like conflicting signals and reckless driving behaviors.
   * The narrator expressed frustration over receiving a traffic violation for prioritizing pedestrian safety.
* **Conclusion**:
   * The test showcased the potential and limitations of the BYD vehicle‚Äôs autonomous driving in extreme real-world conditions.
   * The system‚Äôs reliance on LIDAR and its ability to handle chaotic traffic were impressive, but legal and cultural challenges remain significant barriers.
   * Questions were raised about whether similar autonomous features would be released in other markets like Korea.",2025-01-28 07:35:26,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1ibwef1/if_byd_has_fsd_v13_already_in_china_whats_teslas/

1fxayka,Reminder ‚Äî¬†Q3 2023 was a down quarter due to planned factory outages.,"A lot of mixed signals going on in this subreddit this week. Some exuberance, some lamentation of decayed growth, some simultaneous sentiment that growth is magically back on the table, and frankly a total grab-bag of other assorted takes. 

One thing keeps getting missed in the analysis though, and I'll be brief about it ‚Äî Q3 2023 [was a down quarter due to planned factory upgrades](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-deliveries-expected-fall-plant-shutdowns-soft-demand-2023-09-29/) and retooling for the launch of Highland, which began China sales in October of 2023. You can go back at Tesla's [own Q3 2023 deck](https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/IR/TSLA-Q3-2023-Update-3.pdf) which mentions the factory shutdowns several times, or [contemporary reporting which also mentioned it](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/business/tesla-third-quarter-sales.html).

Looking at the numbers quarter-by-quarter, the aberration is clear. It's hard to stay where Tesla would have ended up had Q3 2023 been a 'clean' quarter, but a linear interpolation (which isn't perfect by any means) between Q2 and Q4 would have expectations for Q3 at around 475k. Instead it missed that by 40,000 units: 

* Q1 ‚Äî¬†423k üìà
* Q2 ‚Äî 466k üìà
* **Q3 ‚Äî¬†435k** üìâ
* Q4 ‚Äî¬†485k üìà

Without that downtime, the 2024 YoY growth would almost certainly evaporate, and compared with the interpolation, Q3 2024's numbers of 463,000 disappoint. There's a good reminder here to always be careful when you do analysis ‚Äî¬†it isn't enough to simply compare one quarter to another one arbitrarily, or to even take year-over-year figures and call it a day.

Tesla Inc. operates as a multinational automotive and clean energy company. The companies bulk of revenue currently comes from there manufacturing and delivery of Electric Vehicles, as well as related products and services for the fleet. Meanwhile Tesla's investments into energy generation and storage have already begun paying massive returns, showing a Continued Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 94.71% since beginning operations in 2015. Heading into the next decade Tesla hopes to gain 2 new revenue streams for the company through there investments in The Robotaxi and The Optimus Robot. Both investments plan to overtake Tesla's top revenue stream of Electric Vehicles, moving Tesla towards its proper company description: an autonomous research and development company. Today Tesla primarily operates as an Electric Vehicle company giving them a strong backbone of consistent revenue and autonomous data from the fleet to go towards there investments. In the future Tesla will see a flip in revenue with the top spots going to Optimus Robots and RoboTaxi's. While consistent revenue growth will be shown from Electric Vehicles and energy generation and storage, the growth will not be strong enough to compete with the new investments. In conclusion Tesla Inc's continued backbone of Electric Vehicles and energy generation and storage, paired with new investments into Optimus Robot and Robotaxi make Tesla Inc (TSLA) the best energy company to own over the next decade.

1dqpxdo,Must-Know: The SEC‚Äôs Next Move Against Elon Musk,"Hello.  
I recently came across an article in The Wall Street Journal titled ‚Äú[Elon Musk and the SEC Are on a Collision Course Again](https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/elon-musk-and-the-sec-are-on-a-collision-course-again-6cb1d1b9).‚Äù

I decided to do a deep dive into the whole thing and have concluded **it is likely that the SEC will charge Musk and seek to ban him from serving as an officer or director of any public company**.

If you think that's ridiculous, think again.

**Why?**  
Because the SEC has already done that before.

-----

**Don't believe me?**  
Here is the SEC's [official press release](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-219) from the last time Musk was in trouble *(the ""funding secured to take Tesla private"" tweet)*.

>The SEC‚Äôs complaint ... seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement, civil penalties, and a **bar prohibiting Musk from serving as an officer or director of a public company.**

So, if the SEC already sought that back then, why *wouldn't* they do it again?  
Especially since Musk is now a repeat offender.

-----

Furthermore, I found out that Musk has been legally fighting the SEC in anticipation.  
However, just recently (May 2024), Musk has been **court-ordered** to give the long awaited testimony the SEC has been asking for. This is not an opinion. It's [Case ‚Ññ 3:23-mc-80253-JSC](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.419113/gov.uscourts.cand.419113.52.0_2.pdf).

The parties have agreed it will not last more than five hours.  
And, of course, those upcoming five hours will be critical.

I have already posted my full research elsewhere: [Elon Musk üÜö the SEC: Delays, Dollars, and Drama](https://medium.com/illumination/elon-musk-the-sec-delays-dollars-and-drama-4bc9cf7ac6fe)

I've already asked permission from your Mods.  
The full thing is [there](https://medium.com/illumination/elon-musk-the-sec-delays-dollars-and-drama-4bc9cf7ac6fe) so *you* can make up your own mind.

I explain how Musk purchased TWTR shares, Rule 13d-1(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the problem, the reason why, and everything that has happened in between with all the links to all the sources so *you* can verify things for yourself.

I don't know how this will end. But I know what to expect if/when the SEC sends its press release.  
As TSLA investors, I would assume you would want to know this information in advance.

Have a great day.[](https://medium.com/illumination/elon-musk-the-sec-delays-dollars-and-drama-4bc9cf7ac6fe)",2024-06-28 17:58:22,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1dqpxdo/mustknow_the_secs_next_move_against_elon_musk/

Those who have wanted a big SUV have already bought a Y, and now that other manufacturers have released and are releasing regular-sized cars (C and B segments), also as electric cars, Tesla's market share is starting to melt at a terrible pace.

And when you add to this the shocking damage to the reputation that Musk is causing to the company, we will see how long Tesla will continue.

Perhaps Musk's intention was to slow down Tesla's product development, so that Telsa's business would go more and more in the AI ‚Äã‚Äãdirection and compete with Uber, so that Musk could extort a 25% share for himself, threatening to take away the future AI-uber business.

1ctmdup,When do we really think TSLA will get *full* FSD approval in China?,"I feel like when this happens it will provide enough data for analysts to believe worldwide FSD is coming and price that revenue into their price targets. Especially since Tesla can turn on large fleet of robotaxis pretty much instantly.

Just a plan but still useful guidelines‚Ä¶in Tesla‚Äôs [Master Plan, Part Deux](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux), they expect worldwide FSD regulatory approval happens once 6 billion Tesla FSD miles have been driven. We reached 1B in April 2024. Purely off of this estimate, with 5 billion miles to go and Tesla's fleet now doing 1 billion FSD miles every 2-3 months, we can guesstimate another 10-15 months (January - June 2025) before receiving worldwide regulatory FSD approval.¬†

  
Keep in mind testing robotaxis on taxis in China may shorten the time down from 2-3 months to drive 1 billion miles and of course the 6 billion miles in Master Plan Deux was just a goal‚Ä¶

So thinking about where China stands on approvals, [China Daily](https://cnevpost.com/2024/05/08/china-may-support-tesla-testing-robotaxi-report/) stated Tesla still needs to receive approval to \*\*collect and transmit the data\*\* needed to train Tesla vehicles on driver-assistance features before China gives them full FSD approval.¬†

1cnbci2,"Former Manufacturing Engineer, wanted to share some insight I was sharing w a non-engineering friend of mine on TSLA stock after spending a ton of time digging in to the company and financials.","**My Background:**

I used to be a Manufacturing Engineer and in the engineering leadership development program for one of the largest aerospace/defense corporations in the world.  I spent a lot of time improving manufacturing processes, and offering feedback to design teams on design for manufacturing. With that intro, I wanted to share my insights I recently was noticing about Tesla's touchscreen design. I am copying all this direct from a text I sent to a friend a few days ago üòé:

**From text:**

One of the biggest differentiators for Tesla now that it is well-established is the almost complete lack of buttons.  I would be willing to bet most people do not realize how huge of a competitive advantage this is.  When I was at <my old company> we literally studied the manufacturing efficiencies of Toyota.  As an example, when GM went bankrupt, they had over 200 different part numbers for ‚Äúhorn‚Äù assemblies.  That is mind-blowing.  It is like a mess of spaghetti when you think about all of the engineering diagrams, and also the overlap of design.  So picture you have some issue where a screw hole is having fatigue fracture after a few years in one specific part of the horn assembly. Stuff like this is very common in newer designs for example.  You literally learn by trial and error.  Then the engineers really study the hell out of what is going on, and make a version 2 with the modifications.  At Toyota they only had 2 models of horn assembly, so when you fix a problem like this, at absolute most, you only have to fix it in 2 different part numbers.  But at GM depending on the design overlap, you may have to redesign hundreds of different assemblies.  It is a literal nightmare.  You would have so many updates to do, you would literally have to have a gigantic team of engineers overhauling all of these horn assemblies.  There is no way around that short of just not making replacement parts for your vehicles, which would be like a nuclear bomb blowing your brand value to pieces. 

Over a product life-cycle, you will literally have potentially dozens (or more) revisions to the part diagrams. Meaning you keep learning from little mistakes, failures in production, and manufacturing inefficiencies (meaning parts that are hard to build) and you redesign them to be easier to build.  And then a company that is doing things ‚Äúvery well‚Äù like Toyota is like ‚ÄúHoly Shit!  That horn assembly right there‚Ä¶ we have revised that design 100 times, and it is literally absolute perfection.  We can build that thing to 6 sigma reliability where you have fewer than 3.4 defects per million. This is like the holy grail!‚Äù

The key being that it takes a tremendous amount of effort and revising to get a product to that level of maturity.  Lots of money, and lots of hard work.

But this is where the Tesla advantage comes in

See, by Tesla mostly having no buttons or switches, they eliminate at bare minimum dozens of parts and wiring assemblies, and Assembly Instructions for assemblers, or assembly coding for robots, that all have to go through these product revision processes.  And there is a huge economic moat for Tesla in this regard, because they started it this way pretty much from the beginning.  So the cars have mostly been designed for well over a decade now with none of this.  Yet for Toyota to compete on this, or Ford, Honda, GM, Stellantis, all of them, they have to take their holy grail button/wiring/connector designs, that have gone through literally 100s of revisions, and possibly 10s or 100s of thousands of engineering man hours to get them to this stage, and chunk them in the trash, and redesign everything.  This would cause a reliability problem in the vehicles which would tarnish the brands in the interim.  And this is a massive advantage. So while Tesla did all of this stuff right from the beginning and built everything with this focus on efficiency of design and manufacturing, these others are doing everything the same, because ‚ÄúIf it ain‚Äôt broke, not only don‚Äôt fix it, but please don‚Äôt take all of the engineers 1000s of hours, throw them in the trash and make us start from scratch again‚Äù

And the cherry on top of all of this, is that if you build a button on the side of a seat in a regular car for example, and people bitch about it in car reviews like ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs kind of hard to reach this button. It should be next to the steering wheel‚Äù - from an engineering perspective, that is like ‚ÄúOh my god, we have to redesign the whole fucking seat and dash.‚Äù Because when you move a switch panel, all the interior of the seat has to be moved around. Same on the dash. All the wiring assemblies have to be carefully routed through ridiculously cramped spaces, and assemblers have to have AI (assembly instructions) to tell them how to do all of it.  So all that has to be redone.  On a Tesla, if someone thinks its confusing to adjust something, you just send an update over wifi to the UI.  Almost like magic.  All the cars are just fixed probably by one or two software guys writing the code to fix it.  Compare those two from a cost perspective.  THIS is one huge reason why Tesla is kicking ass on the net margins.",2024-05-08 18:14:15,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1cnbci2/former_manufacturing_engineer_wanted_to_share/

1cg33wt,"Down on metrics, up on speculation","I have no shorts, no calls, and am overall neutral, but I do find the valuation (even at this point), extremely generous. I sold most my stocks between October 2021 and November 2021. I think people have lost sight of the goal, and traded it in for the hopes of getting rich.

So TSLA is up 35% in 5 days because of:

1. More Musk hearsay  
2. Positive misinformation

Been following the stock since release of Model S, and I must say, this thing has gone from valuation based on real metrics and a path to meet goals, to speculations of all kinds and manners.

For example, jump on Musk calling Tesla not a car company, which we've hear before, as he's called Tesla a bunch of start ups working under one roof. Why should the stock jump on him repeating things? Let's not even get into FSD.

Now, the stock jump because articles are misinterpreting what happened in China. Tesla passing China's cyber security requirements doesn't have to do much with with actual FSD, it applies to all connected vehicles, of all brands sold in China. Basically Tesla promised not to collect, store, or sell sensitive data outside of China, and ensures that the data collected isn't personal. The other side of that is in the US, Tesla uses Google maps, which isn't allowed in China, so they haven't been able to use Autopilot. Using Baidu will allow Tesla to turn on some features of Autopilot soon.

How will this effect sales? We don't know. I just think it's very interesting that there has been such a dramatic pump on some not so dramatic news.

I also think it's interesting how all the bulls are hyped about the pump, yet, I'm sure they never could have guessed all of this happening, lol. Of course the same would have happened with the bears, but I feel like there's more metric data for a bear case than a bull case.",2024-04-29 16:14:34,teslainvestorsclub,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/1cg33wt/down_on_metrics_up_on_speculation/
